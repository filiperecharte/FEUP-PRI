When he isn't teaching or writing, he might be found reading, working out, biking, or rooting for the Denver Broncos. Ken lives in Budapest, Hungary and teaches grade five at the American International School of Budapest. One of his books, \"The Top 10 Ways to Ruin the First Day of School,\" is an International Reading Association and Children's Book Council \"Children's Choices\" Honor Book and an Alabama \"Children's Choice Book Award Program\" winner. Ken is available for author visits and virtual author visits.

Davidsun's Loony Bin\"! And his classroom is not what one would call \"traditional.\" He's nicknamed it \"The Fourth Grade Loony Bin,\" and that's exactly what it is, especially when he pits the boys against the girls in a contest to win a ride on his chopped motorcycle. Zany events - ranging from a flatulence test to Kiss-A-Mania - mean you'll never know what's going to happen next. Step into the Loony Bin and find out who wins the wacky contest, and you'll be glad you went along for the ride!",

The action didn't make sense to me - not even remotely - to the point that I was annoyed by the book's events and character decisions. I understand that the action was slapstick funny - it would probably be hilarious in a movie - but it wasn't book funny.",

Just to give you a little taste: try imagining someone jump-roping on a toilet seat, interrupting a football match by stealing the ball, causing havoc among a gang of bikers in New York City - yes, things sort of happen to Tony Baloney, which is the biggest understatement ever ;)",

The book, The Top 10 Ways to Ruin the First Day of School, was about a 5th grade student who did crazy things to get on a TV show he really liked. The book title says much about the style of the writing. The author's intentions were to write for elementary students, around 5th and 6th grade. It had easy vocabulary and a very childish humor. However, for me, I am not a great reader so even though the book was for young children, the level was about right for me and is a great way to start developing to read.",
