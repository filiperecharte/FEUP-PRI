        "description": "The Russian formalists emerged from the Russian Revolution with ideas about the independence of literature. They enjoyed that independence until Stalin shut them down. By then, however, they had produced essays that remain among the best defenses ever written for both literature and its theory.Included here are four essays representing key points in the formalists\u2019 short history. Victor Shklovsky\u2019s pioneering \u201cArt as Technique\u201d (1917) defines the literary as a way to make us see familiar things as if for the first time. His 1921 essay on Tristram Shandy makes that eccentric novel the centerpiece for a theory of narrative. A section from Boris Tomashevsky\u2019s \u201cThematics\u201d (1925) inventories the elements of stories. In \u201cThe Theory of the \u2018Formal Method\u2019\u201d (1927), Boris Eichenbaum defends Russian Formalism against various attacks. An able champion, he describes Formalism\u2019s evolution, notes its major figures and works, clears away decayed axioms, and rescues literature from \u201cprimitive historicism\u201d and other dangers.These essays set a course for literary studies that led to Prague structuralism, French semiotics, and postmodern poetics. Russian Formalist Criticism has been honored as a Choice Outstanding Academic Book of the Year by the American Library Association.",

            "Ah, my first review! And many of you out there who deign to read my natterings here, might just be asking, \u201cWhat a strange little volume for someone to lose their GoodReads virginity by? Somewhere in the mind of some reader and blogger is the question, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he review his favorite book?\u201d for his first foray. Well, I am reminded of my dear Russian literature professor and tutor from my college years. Having read one of my first scribblings, he handed me a Xeroxed copy of Boris Tomashevsky\u2019s Formalist essay, Thematics entombed in this handy little volume. Standing before an open door, I took the bright bit of Formalist thought into my na\u00efve hands while my dear professor Mark Davidov offered me a wise grin roughly translatable into, \u201cAlright punk, let\u2019s see if you dare run this bit of tense floss through the tight, moist catacombs encased in that skull of yours!\u201d I accepted the gleaming, refractory and enlightened little volume of essays and crossed the threshold of becoming a serious and contemplative reader and writer. Unbeknownst to myself, I was not entering a hallway, but a labyrinth. So, into the dripping corridors I plunged, holding this illuminating volume before me, shining brightly upon the once hidden mechanisms and tools of the mad writer, toiling behind the walls like some lonely Daedulus manically gluing and hammering on the wings in order to defy the truculent laws of physics. And while my journey of reader and writer wound through all sorts of false passages, doors opening up to brick walls, startled by skeletons hanging by manacles and chains with obvious teeth marks on bones, and though many inerrant steps led me down to dead ends, this little volume of essays helped set me right and guided me to the many entertaining corridors, leading to gleaming chambers replete with gears and gizmos spinning wildly, sent whirring, throbbing, humming and, sometimes clanking(by lesser writers) by those daring souls who challenged their talents, sat down(had an ass for it) and wrote stories and novels.And what a bodacious lamp these essays were for my searching mind, glowing upon the details and entrails of novels and stories. Reading Tomashevsky\u2019s dissection of the robust and still living body of Gogol\u2019s The Overcoat was a shocking revelation equal to seeing the heartbeats pulsing through the carefully exposed intestines in an operating theater. Tomashevsky\u2019s essay reveals the themes, motifs (dynamic vs. static), images, story vs. plot and the relationship of the hero to all those devices that create the robust bones of stories and novels. Written masterfully, the essay throws light upon the jewels in the robust and rich anterooms that provide the super structure of plot, allowing readers to tramp about the tunnels of novels and stories to reach the next elegantly appointed chamber and shout, \u201cAha! That\u2019s brilliant!\u201d Or not.My father once tried to hammer the point into the confused webbing of my teenage mind on a fine spring day, complete with twittering birds and cheek warming sunshine. On the back patio of my boyhood home, he was hunkered down over his fruit salad, empty spoon hovering impressively over the dish as he paraphrased the romantic composer Johannes Brahms who once, intoned, I suspect with a righteous and stentorian attitude, something on the order of, \u201cStructure gives you freedom!\u201d Well, dad, you were right and it took a slew of dead Russian Formalist Critics to reinforce the point along with countless drips of subliminal references encountered in my daily mundane adventures, splashing upon my writers forehead like Chinese water until I finally acquiesced to the torture and shouted, \u201cOkay, I admit it, you\u2019re right! Structure gives you freedom!\u201dAnd here the Russian Formalists of the first third of the 20th century charged into the fetid colon of literary criticism, cleansed the stale aromatics and detritus of primitive historicism from the twisting Augean corridors with ample blasts of purgative common sense that Harvey Kellogg would appreciate and provided an ample pile of techniques to root about in until, the happy smiling writer lifted up a raw diamond and polished it until it gleamed clear and clean as a usable tool. With Boris Tomashevsky, Boris Eichenbaum and Victor Shklovsky applying the full purifying power of their analysis, Formalism emerged as a great tool not only for critics but burgeoning novelists regarding writing as an actual structured craft rather than a mystical hobby for muddling through by gut instinct alone. Shklovsky\u2019s Art as Technique, deals with the literary device of defamiliarization, a technique of taking a familiar object and describing it as if the writer is encountering it for the first time. Or, in laymen\u2019s terms, ye olde fish out of water technique of story telling, a method used in countless books and films, including the seminal movie of displacement, Splash! Shklovsky simply and elegantly \u201clays bare\u201d the device and offers up the sacrificial example of a flogging described in Tolstoy\u2019s story Shame, where, \u201cto strip people who have broken the law, to hurl them to the floor and rap on their bottoms with switches\u201d and, \u201cto lash about on the naked buttocks,\u201d illuminates the technique thoroughly. Tolstoy could have just written, \u201cThe thief was flogged,\u201d and everyone would have understood, but he didn\u2019t and Shklovsky is there to read and decipher the entrails like some long scarfed gypsy with a crystal ball beside her just in case the translation of signs and wonders of the past needs further enhancement by predictions of the future. In Shklovksy\u2019s stylistic commentary on Tristram Shandy, a digressional, dense, multi-techniqued, labyrinthine (eerily post-Modern) masterpiece meant never to be finished by the writer(narrator) and by extension the reader (Can anyone tell me how many people have started this 18th century masterpiece and actually finished it?! It makes ones head hurt! And is sometimes infinitely boring.), he argues elegantly, through 32 pages, replete with intestinal shaped squiggles representing plot structure, the idea that Tristram Shandy is \u201cthe most typical novel in world literature.\u201d Boris Eichenbaum\u2019s The Theory of the \u201cFormal Method\u201d is an apt defense against the attacks of Stalinists. Though his passionate plea was delivered admirably, the movement was squashed by the debased Soviets. Yet the Formalists lucid theory has out lasted the reprehensible communist government and its kitschy designs to create a new artistic order upon the soft malodorous edifice of Socialist Realism.For writers not wishing to rely on, albeit valuable, gut instinct alone, the Tomashevsky and Shklovsky essays are a rich and fertile soil for rooting about to find the fine truffles of technique. By denuding the methodically applied tools of writers and thus revealing the limbs, boughs and twigs behind the brilliant foliage, the formalists helped remove the beguiling mystique of the writer as part shaman, part demigod. For the observant reader, their \u201claying bare\u201d of the veins and sap routes feeding the leafy fa\u00e7ade do not destroy the seemingly organic magic of the beautifully pruned work, but allows the thorough reader to enjoy the architectural aspects of the entrancing creations of the greatest authors.

            "In general, Formalism was an attempt at a scientific approach to understanding literariness.\u00a0This approach was used sometimes\u00a0to the detriment of aesthetic and moral concerns, which the Formalists denigrated as mere sentimentalism.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Formalists make a strong differentiation between story and plot. They define story as the natural causal sequence of events, this happened and then this happened, etc. Plot is the story defamiliarized (literally made strange in Russian) in the process of telling. Shklovsky saw this device as the key feature of literature as an art. It is what forces us to slow down and consider an object for what it is. However this is done",
            "Most standard histories of Literary Theory start here, with the Russian Formalists, summarise their ideas and then point out why so many of them were 'wrong'.Reading what they wrote, rather than what people said they wrote, is an interesting experience. It's remarkably easy to read. ",

        "description": "Keith Moon was an exception to every known rule. He revolutionized the concept of the drummer in rock & roll, leading from the back rather than offering mere support. With the Who, he achieved far greater international fame than his instrument was meant to inspire, only to treat his celebrity as an ongoing opportunity to send up the whole notion. He sneered at the dominant British stiff upper lip while appropriating it effectively enough to delete his working-class background at will. He tempted fate with an almost unparalleled intake of alcohol and drugs, beckoning the world to laugh with him at his apparent charmed existence. More than twenty years after his death, Moon is still revered as the greatest drummer in rock history and the single wildest personality in an age of pop excess. His life and work have become the stuff of legend. Here, in the pages of this masterful book, is the unvarnished truth.Music Journalist Tony Fletcher has spent more than three years researching Keith Moon's life and interviewing dozens of Moon's friends, colleagues, and associates. The result is an instant classic, the definitive biography of one of rock's seminal figures, a work that brilliantly illuminates both the tender and self-destructive sides of this singular personality.Wielding the force and propulsive power of a novelist, Fletcher leads the reader through Moon's whirlwind career, making his incredible creative trailblazing easily understandable even to nonmusicians. His clear-eyed reporting of Moon's hyperactive, peripatetic offstage life is compelling and comprehensive, remarkable in its ability to remain fixed on the very human being at the center of the maelstrom.This is the story of one of the most outrageous rock stars ever born -- and one of the greatest rock biographies ever written.",

            "Brilliant but also terribly sad, Keith Moon managed to waste his life but also not waste his life at the same time. Tony Fletcher's biography captures this perfectly, and portrays a warm, funny, uniquely talented and well loved man essentially committing suicide for the merriment of others over a fourteen year spell following the initial success of the Who.Moon is so complex that trying to dissect his personality is a formidable task, and Fletcher wisely plays the part of the informed narrator rather than offer too many conclusions of his own. Moon's legendary caperings are genuinely hilarious, and he was almost as gifted a comic as he was a drummer. Indeed, the mid-70s years that he spent in America while the rest of the Who developed side projects to while away the time between stadium tours were his undoing: had he channeled his abundance of talents into acting or comedy instead of blotting everything out with drugs and brandy, he may well have found the happiness and confidence that, while reading, you can't help but notice all but eluded him throughout his life. Interestingly, Fletcher punctures many of the most celebrated Moon legends: the Rolls Royces driven into swimming pools and hotel foyers being the most well known. He also examines why these fictitious events are still routinely quoted as factual - essentially, that everyone wanted to believe in Moon the Loon as much as Keith Moon himself did.Obviously, this is a pretty bulletproof biography of the Who during their best years, too. There's the tantrums, wife beatings, and spite that form the flip side to Moon's up, up and away public persona. The violent death of his personal assistant Neil Boland - which affected Moon for the rest of life - is covered in depth, as is the harrowing experience of Kim, his first wife, whose leaving he never really came to terms with.This is the second time I've read this book in the last few years. I've been listening to the Who a lot recently and wanted to know where Moon picked up his drumming from, how he developed and so forth. No one seems to know, least of all Moon himself, bashing away tunelessly one minute and producing the most exciting sound in pop the next. There are few people who you'd consider had a claim to have been touched by God, as there is no other explanation for their talents: Keith Moon is one of them.The last couple of chapters are hard for a fan to read. They portray a man so beset with insecurities and addictions that he simply does not know who he is anymore. At 32, he looks 50. Worse than that, he looks 50 and heartbroken, because that is what he is at this point, knowing that his talents are being rapidly eroded by a lifestyle that he simply cannot give up. I have always been a fan of Keith Moon, but by the end of this book I loved him. Poor old brilliant Keith. Some people are just so extraordinarily talented that the weight of their brilliance kills them - such was the case with pop's most mischievous son. ",
            "Classic rock biography of the Who's original drummer. Keith Moon was the one and only!One of the sad things about getting older is that you outgrow your heroes. When I was a teenager the Who were my favorite band, hands down. Not because their music was the best, but because I could relate to the anger and confusion and power of their greatest songs. I especially loved the songs on Quadrophenia, like I'm One and Dr. Jimmy. My hero in those days was Pete Townshend",
            "Keith Moon was the drummer for the rock band, The Who, and he was as well known for his wild lifestyle as for his talent. He was the perfect fit for that particular band, due to his energy and his hedonistic ways. Moon was also symbolic of the 1960s, where changing times led to increased use of drugs and booze, both of which contributed to his early demise. There are many rock aficionados who will say their drummer was The Goat. Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Ringo Starr of The Beatles, and so forth and so on. I don\u2019t know enough about rockers to state any opinion, but I do remember thinking that drummers seemed to die earlier than other musicians. In this huge biography, it doesn\u2019t at first appear that Moonie was going to be different than anyone else. He had a normal childhood, he had tons of energy, and he enjoyed life. As he learned to play the drums and find his way in life, he applied his enthusiasm for his craft into becoming a different drummer. He wasn\u2019t the steady backbeat dude, but instead a progressive (and very loud) madboy percussionist. Tony Fletcher does a top-notch job of describing Keith Moon\u2019s drumming for the reader, which is a big help in setting up the background for the escalating success of the band and its members.The Who seemed set to become one of those fleeting British pop bands of the 1960s, built upon youthful angst (\u201chope I die before I get old\u201d) and the Mods (scooters and cool clothes). Then they developed into something else altogether, a stadium top-lining megaband which gained an increased following from younger fans even as the band aged. While the book is obviously focused on Moon, it\u2019s also a great bio of the band itself and of the music industry of that era. It was the time of albums that had themes and FM radio and serious intent. It was also the time of drugs, drugs, drugs, which made me wonder how any of these artists managed to play a chord while stoned.As The Who became more and more famous and wealthier and wealthier, Keith Moon started his downslide. He collapsed before or during shows, a hazard when one takes horse tranquilizers. He became a full-blown alcoholic and he couldn\u2019t always keep it together during recording sessions. In essence, Keith Moon became Moon The Loon, a myth of the rock era. He moved to California in the 1970s, where he seemed lost and alone. Eventually, in 1978, he lost his life due to an overdose. Keith Moon had lived just 32 years at his death, so he did indeed die before he grew old. Somehow, I don\u2019t think he would have liked the 1980s.One of the benefits of starting this book without much prior knowledge of the main subject or about the music industry of that era is to acquire an urge to YouTube everything the author highlights. Early videos and songs display Moon\u2019s amazing drumming and energy, while the later videos show the creeping loss of everything. Wild. I certainly enjoyed reading it, although it is a massive tome.Book Season = Winter (danger levels)",
            "Young, wide-eyed rock boy makes millions and turns into a decadent lout, pillaging everything in his path. Sounds like the Steve Marriott bio, doesn't it? Well, it's also the Keith Moon book written by Tony Fletcher, a 500+ pages of endless legends and verified rumors of rock's most exciting drummer. It's a great book about an unforgettable figure in the history of music. ",
            "This may be the saddest book I've ever read.You know",
            "This was an indulgence that, much like Keith Moon's own habits, became excessive. My brother gave me this book a couple of Christmases ago, and I had started on, put down, started back on it a few times. After reading the more high-brow novel The Sea by John Banville",
            "Moon: The Life and Death of a Rock Legend",
            "This was a really good book, and it is very evident that Tony Fletcher really did his research. Whether you're a fan of the Who, or the legendary drummer that powered them this book provides great insight into the complex mind of Keith Moon and his contributions to rock 'n' roll.Anyone who knows even the slightest detail about Mr. Moon knows that he was basically insane. He took superhuman amounts of drugs, he played the drums far more wildly than anyone had every seen before, and he lived a life of wild excess. There are countless Moon the Loon stories out there and Fletcher does a great job of digging into these stories"

There is nothing stopping them. The doors are unlocked. Other shoppers are able to come and go as they please. But for some inexplicable reason, these ten people cannot pry themselves away from their shopping miasma. The mall closes, and they won't leave. Days pass, and they're still there, eating meals in the food court and sleeping in department store bedroom displays. Then they begin to die off, one by one, murdered by a mysterious killer, and they still won't allow themselves to escape. Carlton Mellick III's \"The Menstruating Mall\" is both a modernized take on Luis Bunuel's \"The Exterminating Angel,\" and a parody of Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None.\" Featuring mock mall advertisements by retard punk hero Food Fortunata and cover art by Skin242.",

            "If you enjoy weird as FUCK fiction then this is definitely the book for you. I\u2019ve read a few by Mellick now and I just love the bizarre tales he comes up with. You definitely won\u2019t find yourself comparing his stories to other stories, there\u2019s just no comparison! While I did enjoy Menstruating Mall (yes it\u2019s as weird as it sounds), I didn\u2019t enjoy it quite as much as the others I\u2019ve read by Mellick. The story itself was bizarre as fuck and hilarious and I enjoyed the hell out of it, especially the play on stereotypes which really made me chuckle. My only complaint is that there were some bits of sex that just didn\u2019t feel necessary and it felt like they were forced into the story. Now I have no issues with some good smutty scenes but don\u2019t just add them in randomly, make it fit with the story please. That aside, this is one of the weirder and most outrageous books I\u2019ve ever read and I\u2019m all for it!",

            "The Return of the Earl was an enjoyable book, but I felt that the romance wasn't as developed as it should have been. The first half itself, was incredibly slow and a tad boring, so not until the halfway point was I hooked. I liked both the main characters, but even by the end, I didn't totally believe they were so much in love with each other. If some of the blather and other pointless moments in the first half had been condensed and in it's place some more time with Julianne and Christian, it would have much better. However, I did enjoy the story, even if I did figure out the whole 'scheme' ahead of time, and it was a nice way to pass some time. 3.5 stars",
            "First in the Botany Bay series. I accidentally picked up the last in this series first but realized in time that there had to be books before it. I realize now that I've already read a later one (Gypsy Lover), but I am glad I then picked this one up.  The story of the heir who shows up and has to prove he's no imposter is interesting enough, but there are quite a few threads that need untangling. While the villain was pretty obvious from the outset, it was also clear that there were a number of things still not clear - and these didn't get clarified until right at the end. A very good read, I thought, with a sensible heroine which is always refreshing.",

            "The nine short stories in this anthology are all from the 1950's, when Dick was just beginning as a science fiction writer, and before he hit his stride as a writer of reality-bending novels. Thus, the stories remind me of Kurt Vonnegut's Welcome to the Monkey House, a collection of stories written before Vonnegut hit his stride as a mainstream novelist, when he was still considered an SF writer. The stories in this Dick collection are rather dated, but I don't mean that in a pejorative way--they are dated because several of them take their themes from the darkest time of the Cold War, set in a near-future when the Cold War has turned into a hot war with the Soviet Union, and pretty much all of the stories share the anxiety and dread of that decade. But they are still eminently readable. ",
            "Premessa: non ho mai visto il film Atto di forza, quindi sono stata piacevolmente sorpresa dal racconto da cui \u00e8 tratto il film.Seconda premessa: non ho letto molto di Dick, ma questa raccolta di racconti mi \u00e8 davvero piaciuta!Questa raccolta \u00e8 davvero piacevole; ovviamente ci sono degli alti e bassi, ma ci sono due racconti che veramente mi hanno dilettata su pi\u00f9 fronti: uno \u00e8 I difensori della Terra (titolo originale: The Defenders) ed il secondo \u00e8 Ricordi in vendita (titolo originale  We can remember it for you wholesale). Sono il primo e l'ultimo racconto della raccolta e mi hanno estasiata.I Difensori della Terra mi ha fatto molto pensare e dopo quanto accaduto recentemente ho quasi sperato che potesse in qualche modo realizzarsi non sarebbe male se riuscissimo a creare delle forme di intelligenza artificiale che per preservarci dall'autodistruzione per guerre ridicole ci obbliga a vivere e lavorare nel sottosuolo fino allo scatto di coscienza utile a portare la pace nei vari popoli nonostante parta da una ormai dimenticata guerra fredda tra Russi e Americani.Il secondo racconto (Ricordi in Vendita)",
            "This collection of short stories by Philip K Dick, published in 1973 as 'The Book of Philip K Dick' and republished in the UK in 1977 under the current title, actually consists of stories first published in magazines in the 1950s. This accounts for their rather antiquated flavour and attitudes. In 'Nanny', children are taken care of by robotic nurses until things go sour with a kind of arms race.In the title story, Earth is in decline far in the future under a controlling, caste-based society based on the idea of reincarnation. Everyone who does practical things, such as farming, are low down on the social ladder, and those who repair technology and deal with metal working etc, the Technos, are the lowest of all. In fact, they consist of Caucasians, who are despised as being possible descended from Neanderthals, and whose ancestors are blamed for the current state of the planet. Due to this attitude, no machinery is repaired and everything is breaking down, while the environment is impoverished and it is hard to grow food, with disease being rife. I won't describe the story further, other than to say by today's standards it probably comes over as racist from the point of view that only white people are capable of developing solutions and turning the situation around.In 'The Defenders' all-out war between the USA and the Soviet Union has resulted in the survivors living underground in massive cities and continuing to pursue the war through the use of surface dwelling robots.'Adjustment Team' is a rather odd story, more fantasy than SF, which deals with the results when one man is in the wrong place at the wrong time. The attitudes of the time are again conveyed by the means of distracting a key female character from pursuit of a vital point of information by having a vacuum cleaner salesman turn up.In 'Psi-Man', the existence of psychics whose powers are demonstrably real has apparently been established since the late 1960s, but by 2017 when the story is set, war has reduced a remnant of humanity to living in communes among wastelands. Only a handful of psychics exist and they live among the ruins and provide services such as healing to the desperate commune dwellers. One is able to time travel by exchanging places with earlier selves and has been back many times to try to convince a key military figure to not tell the President of the USA to launch the initial attack, but without success. This was a rather muddled story with the viewpoint switching around quite a lot, though it ends with a ray of hope.'The Commuter' is a surreal tale of what happens when a community which should not be there eventually comes into existence.'A Present for Pat' is a really odd story, featuring the present - a being from a higher dimension - brought back as a present from Ganymede, and the havoc this creature unleashes. Again, rather fantasy in style.'Breakfast at Twilight' is another war story; this time, a whole family spontaneously are brought forward in time to when the country is bombarded by robot controlled bombs.Finally, 'Shell Game' is the tale of the survivors of a crashed spaceship who are under attack - though it increasingly becomes clear that they are a big part of the problem themselves.I have greatly enjoyed some of Dick's novels, such as Ubik and , but I found these stories rather too much a product of their time. They are from the early part of Dick's career, so are interesting as a historical artefact, but for me do not rate more than 2 stars.",

            "When I read this in fourth grade, I loved it because it was enchanting, and reminded me very much of 'secret hideouts' I made with friends at the same age. When I read it again later in life, aloud to my younger brother and sister ages 10 and 12, I was choking back tears to keep reading aloud, and they were crying. If you've never read it (or, I suppose now, seen the movie) beware, this review is a spoiler! What I have learned from this book is that our assumptions about children and what is appropriate for them are seriously flawed. We assume they need color",
            "You would think that even after seeing the movie and knowing how this ends I wouldn't cry, but here I am. This book was very enjoyable! I can't remember if I read it as a kid, but it was definitely worth reading now that I'm older.The writing is pretty and gives you a very country-vibe with vibrant imagery and cozy settings, but I felt like the characters lacked a lot of description. Maybe it\u2019s a children\u2019s book and i\u2019m not used to the shorter pace, but it felt like a lot more needed to be fleshed out. The relationships between the characters. Day-to-day activities. Dialogue scenes. It all just happened very quickly and it was hard to gauge how much time was actually passing, and it felt like the characters and plot were progressing faster than they probably actually were.I really need to pick up more children\u2019s classics because reading a book written and presumably set in the 70s was so captivating! References to the Vietnam war and the fearlessness about talking about religion and God was just something I rarely see today, and adding in details so particular to the time period almost 50 years ago now was just very cool! I couldn\u2019t get the movie out of my head when I read this, even though I haven\u2019t seen the movie in years. Baby josh hutcherson is so precious that I think it added a spark to the book just seeing his face in my mind. However, comparing the book to the movie was a little bit detrimental because I think I liked the movie a little more? Just because it took more time to flesh out the characters and add detail to the world of Terabithia, whereas in the book Terabithia was, ironically, rather underexplained.I loved how it described Jess as having a nervous gut. There were references to Jess having anxiety in this and i\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t portrayed as something like HE NEEDS TO MAN UP! HE\u2019S AFRAID OF SWIMMING AND HIS DAD PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM TO BE PERFECT, HE SHOULD BE THE MAN OF THE FAMILY! Instead it\u2019s approached as if fear and shyness is natural and you need to work through it organically, and I thought that was really beautiful and encouraging. ",
            "My damn heart is broken \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dThis book broke my heart and left me in tears when I finished up reading it. And I was not expecting it to be this sad and devastating in the end as I went into this children's classic blindly.The story tells about the blooming friendship between two kids, Jesse Aarons, and his new neighbour, Leslie Burke, two lonely kids. Jess being the only male child in his family and expected to take care of errands and his sisters; Leslie being an outcast and bullied at school. The story developed fine and the writing style made it feel like life becomes better with a friend, a sweet younger sibling who looks up to you, an understanding teacher and it's best to avoid negative people be it your family or so called 'friends'. It's the second half that the writing got intense and got me sobbing mad. It dealt with death and grief which I feel were handled well. I cried more so because I got too attached to these characters as well as their pet dog P.T. Leslie's character is delightful and memorable. She's such a nerd! And an amazing personality. Jess's character is amusing. He's that personality which says there's always sunshine after a rainy day.I love the fantasy world they built. It's something to be rejoiced and something for which a price had to be paid unfortunately.I didn't enjoy the stereotypes of body shaming, the way some characters were described and in some instances the unwelcomed violence in a book which is meant for children. But a memorable read indeed!",
            "Oh I loved this book too! Its so sweet, and sad and wonderful. I cried. My teacher read it out loud in my 5th grade class and when the character died, I turned to the little boy next to me , and said, That's not true is it? and he looked at me with tears in his eyes and nodded. It was probably one of the first mature interactions I ever had with an icky boy.",
            "This is one of the books that taught me that Books Can Hurt. It was part of what I now consider to be my fourth grade teacher's reign of terror - she read Where the Red Fern Grows and Bridge to Terabithia out loud to us (and those are just the books I was in her class for), and I seriously think she did it for the days when, inevitably, the entire class would spend the afternoon weeping at our desks.That said, though - and it needed to be said - this is a good book; it was so engaging to me at that age that I got it from the library after the first day she read it to us and finished it by myself later that night. (Admittedly, this was not uncommon behavior for me. I did not like reading at other people's paces.) Of course, this meant I got to cry twice, and also spend the intervening time trying not to cry because I knew what was coming. The characters are engaging. The story is memorable even 25 years later. But this is the book that taught me two important lessons: do not trust Katherine Paterson as far as you can see her, and do not trust fourth grade teachers, either. ",
            "This is absolutely a great book. I loved to read it!I don't know if you ever watch the film from 2007, if you do, but you haven't read the book, I can tell you that the movie is a good adaptation BUT it can mislead you in the fantasy factor",
            "Even when I was 12, I thought this was a crap book.What's with all the hype? This was so fucking boring. I read this in 6th grade, during a time when I was prone to sobbing at anything. We watched Ben Hur in class and I cried like a baby. I don't even remember why. We read Where the Red Fern Grows aloud in class and I was sobbing in front of everyone. I didn't shed a single fucking tear for this book.",
            "No, I'm not crying. There's just a log in my eye. Okay, so I read this YEARS ago. Maybe when I was 14? I saw the movie first and that absolutely ruined me. I think this is about my 3rd reread, which proves this book is timeless. As well as, you know, heart ripping. I thought I'd be okay reading this. BUT I WASN'T. I JUST WAS NOT. I JUST ABOUT CHOKED UP WHEN THE DAD SAID:Lord"

            "Bloom was a practicing psychotherapist, so it\u2019s no surprise she has deep insight into her characters\u2019 motivations. This is a wonderful set of stories about people who love who they shouldn\u2019t love. In \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d a new mother falls for the obstetrician who delivered her baby; in \u201cSleepwalking,\u201d a woman gives in to the advances of her late husband\u2019s son from a previous marriage; in \u201cLight Breaks Where No Sun Shines,\u201d adolescent Susan develops crushes on any man who takes an interest in her. My favorite was probably \u201cLove Is Not a Pie,\u201d in which a young woman rethinks her impending marriage during her mother\u2019s funeral, all the while remembering the unusual sleeping arrangement her parents had with another couple during their joint summer vacations. The title suggests that love is not a thing to be apportioned out equally until it\u2019s used up, but a more mysterious and fluid entity.Linked short stories can be a useful halfway-house for readers who prefer novels and are still unsure about reading stories. Happily, then, the heart of this collection is five pieces that orbit around the same characters. In \u201cHyacinths\u201d we meet David as a boy in Manitoba and get a glimpse of him as an adult. In the next story we encounter his second wife, Galen, and her lover, Henry. \u201cSilver Water\u201d is about a mental health crisis with David and Galen\u2019s daughter, and the next two stories are about Henry, his wife Marie, and the other bonds they form.Although I read the book quickly while on holiday and so haven\u2019t marked out any particular quotes, convincing dialogue and insightful observations are on almost every page. I was reminded most of short stories I\u2019ve read by Elizabeth McCracken and Carol Shields.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck.",
            "This 1993 collection of short stories has been on my to be read list since 2010, and once I started it for my tbr explode project, I couldn't put it down. All stories are focused on relationships, sometimes groups of stories from different perspectives, some are unusual types. Just like I'm used to from later works by this author, she has realistic insight into the inner workings of her characters.",
            "This is my first book by Amy Bloom, so I really had no idea what to expect. Throw in the fact that I don\u2019t read collections of stories very often and this is really new territory for me.Come to Me is a collection of a dozen stories, a few of which are connected by a character or two in common. But in every case, the story has at its core a dysfunctional or inappropriate relationship. We have 18 year olds marrying 50 year olds, married couples taking lovers together, a married woman who has an affair with a transvestite hairdresser, parents who drive children away, even a father who threatens to kill his own child. It\u2019s an odd collection of characters who are all struggling to make sense of their lives. None of this is a surprise when you learn that Amy Bloom was a practicing psychotherapist when she wrote this book. She remained a therapist until about ten years ago. In fact, a couple of therapists feature in the stories. So her experience with people in therapy have supplied her with insights into humanity most of us can\u2019t have.Bloom has an uncanny ability to draw the reader into each new story in an amazingly quick fashion. Within a paragraph or two, the reader\u2019s immersed in the new dynamic of each tale.My only hesitation with this collection (other than the fact that everyone\u2019s screwed up) is that on occasion Bloom adds an element extremely abruptly. And one story ends that way, so abruptly that it was jarring. But if that\u2019s my only real complaint with a debut work, I have to mark it a success. Bloom is unusual in that she\u2019s written four collections of stories and four novels. Most fiction writers focus on one or the other throughout the bulk of their careers. I\u2019m anxious, then, to read one of her novels as a comparison. Her most recent novel, White Houses, is historical fiction, so that one especially interests me. If her novels are as compelling as her short stories, I\u2019ll be looking forward to reading them all.",
            "Pretty sure I had/read a first cover hard copy of this back in 94. Lent it out. Wish I had it, 'cause this little book of stories is haunting. Dirty laundry not quite aired. Interlocking lives and stories. Complications. I couldn't have told you before I reread this what the stories were about, but I've always remembered the book, the cover, the (w)holes it left. You can't say that about every book you never got back. And after rereading each little world, I remembered the lives, the unfinished-ness in them all.Favorites:Love is Not a Piethe interlocking stories through the middle-which is like more than half the book!and the last two: When the Year Grows Old",
            "Really good collection of short stories. I found them to be compelling, well written and insightful. The content is emotionally raw. It goes to dark places. But, its fascinating. I was really quite taken with the collection. Amy Bloom has a way with story that gets right to the core of the emotional impact of a variety of life events. Despite the rawness of the content, there is balance within the collection as a whole. There is dark as well as light. I really enjoyed the collection.",
            "Amy Bloom- what an amazing author. She writes so beautifully, and so movingly, I read her and am jealous for a week that I lack this kind of talent. The short story Silver Water will knock your socks off",
            "Molly Bloom is one of my latest literary crushes. I had never heard of her, but Pam Houston put her on my reading list. I don\u2019t just want to write like Bloom, I want to BE like her. If I had a therapist, I would want her to be my therapist, too. She divides her time between her therapy practice and her writing, and if I had to imagine the ideal fiction writer as psychotherapist, it would be her. She writes about perversions, obsessions, love and passion in its deepest, darkest crevices without any moral judgment. Her compassion humbles me, and her wit and nimble prose are a delight.",
            "Should a short story collection be graded on its best stories or should it be critiqued as a whole? I ask this question because there are maybe one or two stories in here that are superb, but the rest are good but not great. Silver Water's definitely in that first category. It differs from the other stories in that it's more poetic in its character descriptions and its narrative. Therefore, causing it to flow so well."

            "The Shadow and the Star is a very dark story that could have benefited from a few more lighter moments. Still, I was able to find a stark beauty in it's raw emotional intensity. I have to give kudos to Laura Kinsale for her willingness to tackle a topic as difficult and painful as the abuse and prostitution of children with great compassion. Having the hero be the one who had suffered this abuse makes the story rather unique to the genre. The actual abuse scenes are little more than brief snippets, and in my opinion, are non-graphic and handled in a genteel way. Yet, sensitive readers should know that the psychological fallout of Samuel's past abuse is incredibly intense. I was also able to appreciate the uniqueness of the ninja training and Japanese cultural references, again something that is not often found in romance. I do enjoy a book that goes beyond the normal standards of it's genre and is written with enough intelligence to make me think. That said though, there were times that the cultural references went a bit too far beyond my understanding, yet did not fully engage my interest enough to drive me to do my own research about the topic. There were some scenes and details, not just in the cultural realm, but overall, which I think could have been pared down for the sake of picking up the pace a bit.The Shadow and the Star contained many wonderfully written elements. Ms. Kinsale has a talent for writing intoxicatingly sensual scenes that are created by a mere look or the barest of touches. There were also some beautifully romantic moments which were created from the simplest of things, such as the first gift that Samuel gave to Leda. This scene fairly made me swoon. I also thought that the initial love scene between Samuel and Leda was very well done and quite awkwardly realistic considering that both characters were virgins, which in itself is another unique story element. Ms. Kinsale also has a very nuanced writing style in which there is much left unsaid that must be read between the lines. At times this was another unique and wonderful element in the story, but admittedly this is not the easiest style to follow, and there were times that I felt like perhaps I missed something, especially at the end. Samuel had spent the better part of the book in emotional turmoil, struggling to reconcile his passions and desires as normal human responses. I never quite understood how, when, or where this finally happened. I have the sense that the answer was to be found somewhere in the symbolism of the events surrounding him, but as much as I tried to conjecture about it, the point at which Samuel was able to reconcile his feelings was never fully clear to me. Because of this, I found the ending to be pleasant and happy, but not entirely fulfilling.A couple of things about the story frustrated me a bit though, with one being the lack of communication between the hero and heroine. There were several times throughout the story when one of them would think of something they wanted to say to the other, yet for one reason or another, the words never passed their lips. I can't help but wonder if the story might have been richer and fuller if they had simply said what they were feeling. There was also never any discussion between these two characters about Samuel's past beyond a mere admission on Leda's part that she knew. I know that they were both rather shy characters, but I still thought that it might have added depth to their relationship if they had discussed their feelings surrounding this issue or just simply had discussed their feelings in general. Leda didn't seem to have any difficulty droning on about insignificant things such as home furnishings, but when it came to the truly important things, such as saying, \u201cI love you.\u201d or expressing a need for intimacy, it seemed like she felt that these were improper topics of conversation. I think it might have been even nicer if Samuel had gotten to a point that he trusted Leda enough to tell her of the past abuse himself, rather than the knowledge of it having come from Tess. Another thing that bothered me just a little was the mystical, magical aura surrounding certain parts of the story. There were times that Samuel reminded me more of a Jedi than a flesh and blood man which seemed a little out of place in a historical romance and better suited to the paranormal genre. I also have to admit to being a bit unnerved at the strangeness of Leda's \u201cdear sir\u201d formalities with Samuel even after they were married and in the midst of passionate moments. I'm afraid I just can't imagine calling my husband by such a title.;-)The characterizations were extremely well done exhibiting a great deal of depth. I adored Samuel as the hero. I guess I have a certain preference for brooding, tormented heroes, and Samuel definitely fit this category. Underneath his seemingly cold, distant exterior beat a kind, gentle and loving heart. I liked the way that the author used Samuel's ninja training to empower his character. I found his avenging angel persona to be very sexy and appealing, and would have liked to have seen more of these types of exploits in the story. I loved the way that he was able to shut down the child prostitution rings so neatly and quietly, with no fanfare, and never resorted to any kind of violence. I think it would be impossible not to like a character such as Samuel who possessed such intelligence and ingenuity while being drop-dead gorgeous. His character's emotional intensity was heart wrenching, but gave him so much humanity. Considering the dark nature of Samuel's character, I thought that the overall story would have been more balanced if Leda had been a bit more vibrant and passionate rather than being so reserved, proper and somewhat intense in her own right. For all of her supposed French blood, Leda didn't really act very \u201cFrench\u201d. I have found that most of the very best romances featuring tormented heroes, have a lighter heroine. In this respect, I thought that Ms. Kinsale's \u201cyin and yang\u201d were a bit off. That said though, Leda was still a very likable character. She was every bit the lady in spite of her non-titled status, being very graceful and composed. She had scruples that she lived by almost religiously. I also like that she was described as rather plain-looking, but best of all, she was kind, gentle, trusting and understanding toward Samuel and never pitied him for his past, only saw a strong, remarkable man. She was also able to intuit his needs and never left him even when, in his fear, he tried his best to drive her away.Many of the secondary characters were also well written. I really enjoyed all of the flashbacks to Samuel's post-abuse childhood with the Ashlands, and his times training with the family's old butler, Dojun. I found Dojun to be a rather confusing and ambiguous character though, because most of the time, he seemed to be a loving father-figure to Samuel, offering him a way to build confidence and empower himself, but by the end of the book, it seemed that Dojun had given Samuel the training for rather selfish reasons. Again, perhaps this was simply one of those read-between-the-lines nuances that I was missing. Kai was a lovely and lively but rather complex character, who at times seemed rather childish and shallow, though not annoyingly so, and at other times seemed very responsible for her age. Readers also get a good look at where Gryphon and Tess are about two decades after their own love story took place in The Hidden Heart, and it's nice to see that they are still passionately in love.While I have not seen any official series designation for any of Ms. Kinsale's books, The Shadow and the Star is basically a sequel to The Hidden Heart. As I mentioned, The Hidden Heart is Gryphon and Tess's story, and they play fairly significant roles in The Shadow and the Star. Samuel first appeared briefly in The Hidden Heart as a child who, at the time, was still in the throes of horrible abuse. I rarely read series or interconnected books out of order, but I made an exception in this case, as I was unable to find a copy of The Hidden Heart at my local library. The Shadow and the Star was the first time I had read a book by Ms. Kinsale, but I liked it well enough that I would definitely like to acquire a copy of The Hidden Heart, so that I can go back and fill in the beginnings of this story, and would also be open to reading other titles written by her. As it was though, I believe the two books stand well on their own, as there was enough back story given that I didn't feel lost at any point. Enjoy might be a bit of a strong word for a book that is as hauntingly intense as The Shadow and the Star, but I can say that I appreciated the story a great deal. Though we may not wish to face the reality of such evil in the world, it does exist, and I found that the story really made me think about that on a very deep level long after turning the last page. If you are looking for a book to escape reality this one is definitely not it, but if you are looking to broaden your horizons with a story that expresses a beautiful uniqueness and incredible poignancy and depth then I would highly recommend The Shadow and the Star.",
            "The Victorian romance where Samuel is a child prostitution survivor and a Hawaiian ninja. I can add nothing to this.No, actually, I can, because I'm afraid I didn't really care for either of the major characters.Leda comes across throughout as a little old woman. A conventional little old Victorian woman with a commonplace mind. I sympathized with her plight, yes, but I didn't see anything special about her whatsoever. Samuel apparently knows only two women his age, and the other one might as well be his sister; it's hard not to feel that once he gets out into the world a bit, he'll notice that women are different from one another and wonder why he picked this one.Samuel is about as damaged as you would expect him to be, and it's sad, because of course he's some years too early to be able to talk to Doctor Freud about his problems, and Victorian culture forbids him to talk to anyone else -- but, rather like Dain in Lord of Scoundrels, he's so very self-involved that my reaction to him tips rather suddenly from woobification to annoyance. By the end of the book, Leda knows all about his past difficulties, but he knows nothing about hers, nor does he ever think to fill her in on what's happening in the present. In fact, now that I come to think of it, I don't remember Samuel ever taking any interest in anything about anyone except what he needed from them. I'm sure the author didn't intend to create a monster, and since Samuel's needs are emotional rather than mercenary, it doesn't hit you right away, but I'm not actually sure he's aware that others have needs at all.The other cultures are sensitively handled -- one thing I particularly appreciated was having pidgins clearly labeled as pidgins, rather than presented without explanation so that the speakers of them look like ignoramuses. ",
            "This is such a poignant story. I can't begin to review it and do it justice. It's a story that needed to be told and the story I needed to hear. Anyone who's read or listened to The Hidden Heart knows what tragedy occurred in that book, to an innocent child, and wasn't resolved. The Shadow and the Star is the resolution of that tragedy and is absolutely beautiful. As my friend, Bean, said - it'll rip your heart to pieces, then put it back together. (I can't find the comment to quote it, but that about sums it up.)Anyway, once again the team of Laura Kinsale and Nicholas Boulton can't be beat. I can't recommend them highly enough and look forward to more of their brilliant storytelling. Storytelling at its finest.BlurbIn defense of her honor, innocent Leda Etoile has burned all her bridges and taken refuge in her tiny attic room in a shabby boarding house in London. But her last safe haven is invaded when she wakes to find a man hidden in the dark - a man with golden hair and the face of a fallen angel, who moves in the night like a shadow.Will he be her savior, or her ruin? Samuel Gerard draws her inexorably into the richest circles of aristocratic England. But even as Leda falls in love with a man she can never have, she must keep his secrets. Though everything about him is shame and illusion, this shadow warrior desperately desires what only Leda can give him - absolute love, and the truth about himself.",
            "Rese\u00f1a completa: https://masromance.blogspot.com/2021/...Uno de mis favoritos de Laura KinsaleSabe muy mal terminar estas novelas, porque seguir\u00edas leyendo y leyendo, y soy consciente de que mi siguiente lectura me sabr\u00e1 a muy pocoUna novela de personajes, evoluciones, contrapuntos. Personas reales con problemas que no cambian de forma repentina, porque cuando alguien est\u00e1 tan da\u00f1ado, se aprende a vivir con ello y el amor, por mucho que queramos, no lo cura todo. Eso es, para m\u00ed, lo mejor de la novela, el realismo del personaje de Samuel: tosco a veces, serio, directo, con sus complejos y con ese f\u00edsico que contrasta tanto con lo sombr\u00edo de su car\u00e1ctersu relaci\u00f3n con leda no ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil ni tan siquiera un cuento de hadas, porque los comienzos entre dos personas tan diferentes y tan inocentes no pueden ser f\u00e1ciles. otro punto muy realistaMi \u00fanica pega es que la relaci\u00f3n con Lady Tess y Kai se cierra de forma demasiado abrupta, no hubiera costado nada que ambos personajes con tanto peso durante la primera parte de la novela, aparecieran al final aunque fuera para decir dos frases.El animal de esta novela es el tibur\u00f3n blanco ;)Si os gusta la cultura japonesa, aqu\u00ed se encuentra otro alicienteUn trabajo estupendo el que ha hecho Laura Kinsale con el personaje de Samuel, con novelas como esta da gusto \u2665",
            "So, after some serious thinking, I hate this book. And I love this book.I don't hate it for many of the reasons I hear bandied about...I could give a sh!t less about the OW, because she was rarely an other woman. She was barely a woman. She was barely a human. She was a construct of perfection that our fractured hero needed to fool himself in to thinking he was good",
            "Laura Kinsale... E est\u00e1 tudo dito.Uma das minhas autoras favoritas, os livros dela s\u00e3o fabulosos.As personagens e a hist\u00f3ria s\u00e3o cativantes.Lamentavelmente, o primeiro livro n\u00e3o foi editado em Portugal, e nele explica tudo o que aconteceu com Samuel.Quando li a sinopse, julguei que os poderia ler individualmente, as personagens n\u00e3o se repetiam...Puro equivoco, felizmente tenho aquela pancada grande para ler as s\u00e9ries por ordem e rapidamente me apercebi que esta hist\u00f3ria estava dependente do primeiro livro sobre a Tess e como Samuel chega onde est\u00e1 e porque \u00e9 como \u00e9.",
            "This is my second re-read of the book.Published in 1991, it still holds its awesomeness on re-read. I'm in awe of the author who created this unforgettable romance and complex characters. Please, Ms. Kinsale, come back to writing!",
            "Relectura.Es un libro muy original, de \u00e9poca y con v\u00ednculos con Jap\u00f3n y Hawai, la Kinsale es as\u00ed, te puede gustar o no lo que escribe, pero nunca se limita a lo convencional. No es un libro perfecto, el final creo que es un poco flojo y no est\u00e1 a la altura del resto, pero es una historia interesante y fundamentalmente tierna. La primera vez que lo le\u00ed fue hace muchos a\u00f1os, reci\u00e9n publicado en espa\u00f1ol lo compr\u00e9 en la FNAC, todos estos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s todav\u00eda recordaba muchas escenas de Samuel que me provocaron mucha emoci\u00f3n. Y es que, Sombra y estrella es fundamentalmente Samuel, pocos protagonistas hay en la rom\u00e1ntica que muevan tantas cosas como \u00e9l, es inolvidable."

            "This is one of those books that sat in my TBR pile for so long that I totally forgot why I put it there. Continuing my attempt to reduce the mentioned pile last week decided to pick it up. It is a spy story with a twist.The story opens with the hero's mistress, Lady Grenham, setting his clothes on fire and so kicking him out of her life. Dove, the hero, is a bit surprised but takes it in stride after he finds out that she had found another woman in his bedchamber. The woman in the bedchamber, supposedly his other lover is accompanied by a manservant that Dove soon realises is a woman. The woman is Sylvie, the widow countess of Montevrain who has been helping the Duke of Yveshire by finding information that more orthodox spies cannot. The fact is that the Duke blames Dove for the death of his brother and wants Sylvie to uncover information that can ruin him.The plot sounded interesting although one could predictably guess that Dove wouldn't be the villain that Sylvie believed him to be. Unfortunately, in the end, the story did not work for me... The thing is that Sylvie and Dove were not that interesting to me and I found myself thinking of giving up their story several times. There wasn't enough tension between them and Sylvie wasn't anguished enough by her decision of spying on the man she was falling for. There's a mystery for most of the book about what really happened between Dove and Yveshire's brother and when all is revealed I was sorry that that was not a part of the story also. It would have provided the angst that I felt the story needed. And I must say I would have loved to know more about Iveshire and Lady Grenham's relationship.Grade: 3.5/5 ",
            "This novel is a slow burn. Sylvie Georgiana has been hired by the Duke of Yveshire to find evidence to lead to the downfall of Robert Dovenby aka Dove, for the death of his younger brother. Disguised as a boy, she attempts to infiltrate his household and gather evidence. However, Dove already sees through her disguise and attempts to uncover her true purpose in a long cat and mouse chase that takes up the majority of the novel. The explanations and action happen late in the novel. In fact, compared to the excruciatingly long slow burn of the intrigue between Dove and Sylvie, everything just gets wrapped up too quick and perhaps a bit too tidy. The plot very much runs like a gothic novel minus the dark castle and evil guardian. The twists and turns are very convoluted. The reveal at the end comes out of nowhere and the development falls very short compared to the beginning. In spite of it, it still is a very engaging story. ",
            "Awww, man. The second book in the Georgian series falls squarely within the category of it was okay. Which is a real disappointment considering how good the first book",
            "Sylvie Georgiana, Countess of Montevrain became a spy for England after being widowed and impoverished in Italy. Her latest mission is to infiltrate Robert Sinclair Dovenby's household - as a man, to try and get something on him for the Duke of Yveshire. Yveshire thinks Dove deliberately ruined his brother, Edward Vane. In fact, Edward was involved in an operation that drugged young girls and then sexually abused them. When he kidnapped and raped Lady Margaret, Countess of Grenham's young daughter when she rejected Edward in favor of his brother, she enlists Dove to get revenge. Dove pretends to befriend him and slowly bankrupts him and uses the money to pay back those he's defrauded. Edward is finally killed in a duel but Yveshire blames Dove, not knowing what Edward was doing. George falls in love with Dove but doesn't understand the whole story. When Margaret finally releases him from his vow of secrecy it's almost too late, but they do finally pull off a happy ending.",

The sentences are almost flawless and there's a beauty in the phrasing that isn't seen often within romance books. To some, that can be more dramatic and fun, to other readers, however, that can be a pain in the butt.While it took me a little while to get into the story, and appreciate the plot, I never quite got over the wording. Ms Ross is a talented lady, and she has a unique turn of phrase that just makes the story seem superfluous. The dialogue is witty, charming, and oftentimes brilliantly paced. However at some points, the action is almost an afterthought.Regardless, this was a good tale. Even if the focus is more on the storytelling rather than the story.",

        "description": "A modern master of the historical novel, Jeff Shaara has painted brilliant depictions of the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, and World War I. Now he embarks upon his most ambitious epic, a trilogy about the military conflict that defined the twentieth century. The Rising Tide begins a staggering work of fiction bound to be a new generation\u2019s most poignant chronicle of World War II. With you-are-there immediacy, painstaking historical detail, and all-inclusive points of view, Shaara portrays the momentous and increasingly dramatic events that pulled America into the vortex of this monumental conflict.As Hitler conquers Poland, Norway, France, and most of Western Europe, England struggles to hold the line. When Germany\u2019s ally Japan launches a stunning attack on Pearl Harbor, America is drawn into the war, fighting to hold back the Japanese conquest of the Pacific, while standing side-by-side with their British ally, the last hope for turning the tide of the war.Through unforgettable battle scenes in the unforgiving deserts of North Africa and the rugged countryside of Sicily, Shaara tells this story through the voices of this conflict\u2019s most heroic figures, some familiar, some unknown. As British and American forces strike into the \u201csoft underbelly\u201d of Hitler\u2019s Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper. As battles rage along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the momentum of the war begins to shift, setting the stage for the massive invasion of France, at a seaside resort called Normandy.More than an unprecedented and intimate portrait of those who waged this astonishing global war, The Rising Tide is a vivid gallery of characters both immortal and unknown: the as-yet obscure administrator Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose tireless efficiency helped win the war; his subordinates, clashing in both style and personality, from George Patton and Mark Clark to Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery. In the desolate hills and deserts, the Allies confront Erwin Rommel, the battlefield genius known as \u201cthe Desert Fox,\u201d a wounded beast who hands the Americans their first humiliating defeat in the European theater of the war. From tank driver to paratrooper to the men who gave the commands, Shaara\u2019s stirring portrayals bring the heroic and the tragic to life in brilliant detail. A new level of accomplishment from this already acclaimed author, The Rising Tide will leave readers eager for the next volume of this superb saga of the war that saved and changed the world.",

            "\u201cVictory comes from the strategy, the plan, the tools we are given.\u201d\u201cThe Rising Tide\u201d is the first of four books historical novelist Jeff Shaara wrote about WW II. It was better than I expected it to be. This novel follows the North African and Sicilian campaigns of the war, a part of WW II I know little about, despite the fact that BOTH of my grandfathers served in those campaigns. Shaara does an excellent job demonstrating in this novel how pivotal those campaigns were to what came next, the invasion of France. I read a novel, but I learned a lot of history along the way.The 16 page Introduction to the text is as concise and informative an overview of the lead up to, and beginning of, WW II I have ever encountered. It should be used in schools and textbooks. Seriously!In this novel Shaara sticks to his formula, each chapter is told from one character\u2019s perspective, and the ever changing point of view gives a nice complete picture to all sides of the conflict. In this text we get in the heads of Eisenhower, George Patton, Erwin Rommel and occasionally of other historical players. However, the book really shines when we get the perspective of common soldiers. In this text Shaara creates two composite characters to achieve this effect. One is Jack Logan, a tank gunner in the North African campaign, and the other is Jesse Adams, a paratrooper in the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Although they are Shaara\u2019s creations, he uses real things that happened to various GIs and has them happen with these two characters to show the life of the foot soldiers of this conflict. The novel is at its best when we are in combat. Shaara is one of the finest writers I have come across for recreating that experience. The invasion of Sicily is gripping. The author creates vivid and palpable tension as he writes of the US paratroopers jump into Sicily in July of 1943. The human emotions and technical details combine nicely in this section.I read this book quicker than I thought I would, was thrilled that it engaged me in the manner that it did, and I will be reading the other three novels Shaara has written about WW II. Can I say anything more than that that could endorse this book?",
            "The Rising Tide is the story of the American experience in the Second World War in Europe. The action picks up in Africa, waiting on Operation Torch to begin. As with other Shara books, the author follows some of the key actors - Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery, and, intriguingly, Rommel and Kesselring. It is through their eyes that the reader experiences the Desert campaign in North Africa as well as the invasion of Sicily and Italy by the allies.I appreciate the insight into the decision-making and strategy of the generals. This is especially true in the case of Rommel who is portrayed as a brilliant strategist/tactician who is serving a cause he does not fully support and commanders who are misguided at best and incompetent at worst. The lack of resources and bad orders cost the Germans multiple opportunities for devastating victories over the Allies.The perspective is a mixed blessing. While Rommel was interesting, some of the other perspectives were merely vaguely interesting. Exhibit A is Eisenhower who comes across as a bit of a cardboard automaton who emotionlessly builds his strategy and executes on the way to final victory. I would like to see more of the experience of the common soldier - or even a civilian caught up in things. To be fair, Shara does give his readers some of this. In North Africa we follow an American tank man who experiences the horror of taking under-armored American tanks into battle against heavy panzers. And in Sicily we get to follow a paratrooper into combat against an elite unit of SS troops. That was pretty cool.Outside of the perspective, I was taken aback by the beginning of the book. It starts right at the planning of Operation Torch. It felt odd. Somehow I thought it was going to begin earlier, even the invasion of Poland by the Germans. Coming into the war mid-way is disconcerting. Maybe it should have at least begun at the start of the war for the Americans?On the whole, three stars out of five. Shara does what he does. You either like it or you don't. I'm mixed on it. Of course, I will still read the next two books. I enjoy the history.",
            "The first book in Jeff Shaara's series on World War II focuses on the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one person. Some famous / historical such as Eisenhower, Patton, Rommel and others where the protagonist is a fictional character. Actually a composite of real GI's to provide the view of the citizen soldiers and their experiences. One of these fictional characters is Jack Logan, a tank gunner in the North African campaign. The other is Jesse Adams, a paratrooper in the Sicilian campaign.The book opens in 1939. The majority of Americans did not want to get involved and considered it a European problem. Churchill was desperate for help from the United States and Roosevelt tried to help (i.e. Lend Lease Act). Everything changed with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Dwight D. Eisenhower is named the supreme commander of the Allied forces in Mediterranean Theater of Operations. His generals include George Patton, Mark Clark, Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery. They don't often agree and sometimes it is hard to tell they are on the same side. On the other side is Erwin Rommel, the \u201cthe Desert Fox\u201d, a veteran of many battles who hands the Allies their first defeat.Since each chapter was written from the perspective of these different characters the reader gets to know them. Their thoughts and perspectives. What is was like for Eisenhower who was a soldier but had to get everyone to work together for the common cause. Basically he was forced to be a diplomat. Not always easy when you are dealing with someone like Patton. Or those who thought the Americans were a bunch of cowboys. Lots of egos and personalities.As is usually the case in Shaara's stories the most interesting parts of the story are those that deal with with the common soldier. Here we have Jack Logan and Jesse Adams. To be in a tank in the middle of a battle. Or to jump out of a plane in the middle of a night not knowing what was below you.I would be interested in reading the other books in the series. At the end of this story the Allies prepare for Operation Overlord. The Battle of Normandy.",
            "Ever since reading Gods and Generals I have been convinced that Jeff Shaara doesn't have anything like the gift for writing his father, Shaara, Michael, exhibited in the breathtaking historical novel The Killer Angels. This book cemented my impression.If you want to read some interesting World War II history (specifically, the time period around the American entrance into the war in North Africa) that focuses on the personalities of the generals involved: this is a great resource. I have little doubt that the writing is very, very well-researched and I did learn things that (even as a minor WW2 buff) I didn't know about Patton, Eisenhower, Montgomery, Rommel, and others. I feel like I definitely *learned* something from reading this book. It just wasn't a lot of fun to do. It's like 3/4 a well-written textbook interspersed with 1/4 of a mediocre action novel.",
            "Shaara's books are always entertaining and this was my first of his that dealt with the subject of World War II. This book focused on the battles North Africa and then Italy. As always, Shaara writes each chapter from the perspective of one person and alternates between famous people and unknown soldiers to tell both the big picture and on the ground stories. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Eisenhower and Rommel - and some of the work on Patton as well. If you enjoy history, Shaara is can't miss.",
            "As much as I love all things Shaara, having consumed a dozen novels from Jeff and his father, Michael, The Rising Tide is probably my least favorite. IMO, the book tries to cover too much ground (literally). We read about the numerous conflicts between Rommel's panzer division (Germans), Montgomery's Desert Rats (Brits), Ike/Bradley/Patton (Americans), and Musolino's Republican Army, initially taking place in Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, etc. Then they proceed from Africa to Sicily, then Italy. The book reads more like a history book, than a typical Shaara novel that dives into the characters of a dozen or so key players. I learned a lot from reading The Rising Tide, but failed to become engaged in the story.",
            "My experience was the opposite of one of the reviewers here. I enjoyed the staff meetings in the interplay between the generals, particularly the diplomatic difficulty of Eisenhower as compared to the bluntness of Patton. For whatever reason, I didn't get into the battle scenes as much. Overall, I didn't find this book nearly as engaging as those of the Revolutionary, Mexican, and Civil War. Still, the author has earned my loyalty with his unique work, and I look forward to continuing to read this trilogy. It definitely makes one appreciate that victory in World War II was not a foregone conclusion.",
            "Jeff Shaara made an admirable attempt to complete his father's Civil War series, but his sequels, valuable though they are, could not hold a candle to The Killer Angel. Well, Jeff has done a lot of writing since then, and his WWII series, if The Rising Tide is a fair indication, matches the work of his father. What Michael Shaara did for the Civil War, his son is doing for the Second World War. One of the marks of good historical fiction, for me, is the way it prompts me to start researching stuff on the internet. And that's what I found myself doing in Tide. Another of telling sign happens when I find myself living what the characters are going through, and in Jeff's chapters on the tank battles between Rommel and the Allies, I felt the awe. To a lesser extent, only because this topic receives less coverage, is his portrayal of the training and daring of the paratroopers. There are many similar scenes in Tide - POW camps, stress disorders, command failures - that truly bring home the complexity of the topic to readers who have never experienced warfare at any level. The only other WWII series that does this so well is Herman Wouk's Winds of War, and War and Remembrance.The Rising Tide is a valuable addition to WWII fiction."

They are her favorite fruit, but she does not really have much of the opportunity to enjoy them because they are expensive, and her family cannot afford them. One day, a surprise showers into Yangsook\u2019s town, and she must decide on what to do with this big surprise! The first thing that I noticed upon reading this book was that the book was originated in China because of the Chinese letters that are written throughout the book. I thought that was neat. Some design elements that I also noticed were the bright colors the illustrator incorporated on each page. Each page kind of popped out in its own way. I also noticed that the illustrations were all watercolor-like paintings. The had soft brushstrokes that were beautiful. As for literary elements, I noticed that the author uses shorter dialogue for beginner readers. She also uses very descriptive words that paint a picture in your head. It made is age appropriate for earlier readers. This book is one of Youngsook Choi\u2019s most known books because of the pretty flow, and the beautiful illustrations. I really enjoyed this book, it was like reading fun paintings with words!",

And one day it was raining really bad and the peaches from the peach orchard ended up in the flooded streets of her small village. She was happy to have peaches but then she realized that the farmers wouldn't be so happy to see almost all of their peaches gone and decides to find a way to put all of the peaches back on the trees, and she did. And in the end, she had a surprise growing in her yard at home, a peach tree.This book is a great book to read to children because it's a great book to show them that good things come to people who are nice to others. And the fact that she didn't have to bring the peaches back to the farmer showed that she had a really kind heart and really wanted them to happy to see that all their peaches were still there rather than keeping them.",
            "Peach Heaven is a book about a young girl that loves the peaches in her hometown and how one day the sky rained down those beautiful white peached. The story is relatable and is told from the point of view of a young child with a very creative imagination. The book gives an insight to another culture and Choi does good job of transporting the reader to the setting that she intended. The use of the descriptive words help engage the reader and helps them imagine what the peaches would really be like. Reading this story was like taking a bite out of a sweet white peach, transporting the reader to their own peach heaven!",

In fact she loves peaches and their sweetness so much that she chooses to complete her homework assignment about them. Yet one day one of the worst hailstorms in history destroys the peach farmers crops. So Yangsook and her friends devise a plan to help the farmers. The author wrote this story based on her own vivid recollections of the storm that made the peaches rain from the trees on August 12, 1976. This information is added at the end of the book Author's Note. The author's note also discusses the cultural relevancy of peaches in Korean mythology. I felt that this was a wonderful addition to add to the end of the book because it does not distract the readers from Yangsook and her love of peaches for what they are to her. Choi also does a nice job revealing the family dynamic subtly with the inclusion of Yangsook's grandma living at home with the family and helping raise Yangsook and her younger brother. "

            "Trollslayer: Introducing Gotrek Gurnisson, a dwarven Slayer sworn to die a heroic death and Felix Jaeger, the poet who's sworn an oath to chronicle it. In the stories in the first book contained within this omnibus, Gotrek and Felix encounter cultists, wolf-riding goblins, a ruined dwarven stronghold, a mutant-creating sorceror, and werewolves, among other things.For years, people have been telling me to read this, saying it's comparable to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser series. After half a decade of putting it off, I finally picked it up. The big Warhammer logo on the front was off putting, so much so that I almost put the book back down. I mean, fiction based on a role playing game? And who is this William King person anyway? So, I've read through the first story. Are they as good as Leiber's stuff? Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. But they are a rip-roaring good time. I enjoyed myself tremendously. Gotrek is a one-dimensional killing machine but he has funny lines. Felix, on the other hand, is a well developed character that continually examines his place in the world.William King isn't a bad writer, either, despite me never having heard of him and this being a RPG tie in. Honestly, I'd say his writing is as good as David Gemmell's. The stories are well done, although there are some fantasy cliches present. One thing that pleased me is that the setting seems to be more Eastern European based than most fantasy.All in all, I'm enjoying the heck out of these.Skavenslayer: Felix and Gotrek settle in Nuln for a time and find work first as sewerjacks and then as bouncers, all the while encountering the machinations of the skaven in the city's sewers. Can Felix and Gotrek foil the sinister pllots of the skaven?The second book in this omnibus is a collection of short stories, much like the first. The stories in this one, however, are much more closely tied together. While I liked Skavenslayer, I didn't enjoy it as much as Trollslayer. The stories were a little too Felix-heavy and I never thought the skaven were compitent foes for Gotrek and Felix. Still pretty enjoyable though, good action and a lot of laughs. On to the third book!Daemonslayer: Felix and Gotrek join a Dwarven expedition into the Chaos Wastes aboard an airship, searching for the lost Dwarven citadel of Karag Dum. But what will they find when, or if, they get there?Daemonslayer has the epic feel the other two books were lacking and is full of dwarfish goodness. More of Gotrek's pre-Slayer past is revealed, but there are still many questions. Snorri Nosebiter, another Slayer, is introduced. The airship is described well and actually seems plausible. I like that the Warhammer dwarves are good at technology. The journey to Karag Dum doesn't drag, as many epic journeys do, and the final battle is probably in my top ten fantasy final battles of all time.Upon completing the First Omnibus, I will say that I liked it a lot. It was 700+ pages of pulpy fantasy goodness and I plan on getting the Second Omnibus soon. Gotrek & Felix won't make you forget about Fahfrd and the Grey Mouser but they're entertaining as hell. I'd recommend this book to pulp fantasy fans, as well as fans of David Gemmell.",
            "This book (actually a collection of the first 3 books in this series) is incredible! William King is a phenomenal writer. I was sad when Nathan Long took over the series - nothing against Nathan Long, who is also a great writer. But King just fleshes out his characters in such a way that makes you feel like you know them. And that is impressive when writing about elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, skaven (rat-people), and vampires. I haven't met any of those yet. I have yet to read a William King book that isn't a constant page turner. There is no lull in the story, even though there isn't constant action (there is a lot of action though). Even when Gotrek and Felix are drinking beers in a pub, you can't wait to see what happens next. And there is plenty of humor.Even if you have never read a Warhammer book and never plan to again, check these out. It really isn't necessary to know anything about the Warhammer universe to get into the stories. In fact, you can learn a lot about it by reading these books (if that's what you want to do). This duo travels extensively, so you really get to read about most of the races and the world itself. ",
            "We should rest here for the night...You manlings are all the same",
            "Although William King might have invented the characters, he is a terrible writer, the characters are one dimensional and the descriptions bland.The books do get better though, especially Deamonslayer had a very epic feel about it, so I still recommend reading the omnibus if planning to read the whole series.",
            "the first three novels of the long history of two dissimilar heroes an unconventional pair of an adventurer, a dwarf slayer and his human companion and doom recorder. this first tome has two factions. to entertain with stories of high adventure, extreme gore, and blood-soaked battles but also to present places of the olde empire and people and monsters of the Warhammer fantasy setting. the writing is not the best you can find but the narrative is easy and fun to read the stories are one way but enjoyable. thousands of enemies die by the great axe of the unconquerable dwarf hero Gotrek but the heroes seek for more enemies and the tale continues... ",
            "Didn't care much for the short stories at the end after you've just finished such an epic tale, but had lots of fun readint this omnibus!",
            "If you are already familiar with the world and lore of Warhammer, then you will find an really enjoyable read in the tales of Gotrek & Felix. This omnibus features a large number of small stories that are not very connected to each other in the beginning, do begin to arch into an overall larger story. For people not yet introduced to Warhammer lore, I could imagine that the world might seem a bit daunting at first, primarily because I feel like that William King needed some time to familiarize himself with the characters, though the later stories become more and more ingrained into the world. The first short stories can be read entirely apart from each other, but from Skavenslayer and onward the stories begin to intertwine into each other and become much more enjoyable because of it.I can say that while I had my doubts at the beginning, that I now look forward to read more about the adventures of Gotrek & Felix in the next installments."

            "Wow! This book was absolutely wonderful! It was such a cute story about friendship and coming to terms with death. I loved it! Don't let the cover fool you, though it look's scary I wouldn't particularly say it is. Though for a very young child it might be a little unsettling as we learn very early on that the main character, Ashley, had lost her father to cancer. We also learn about a little girl around her age she and her new friend, Kristy, has met in the garden. But this little girl is very different from Ashley and Kristy, because she died seventy years ago. Even with the subject of death being a very strong topic in this book it was still a great read as all of Mary Downing Hahn book's I have read so far are. Such a beautiful story with a beautiful outcome. It also is quite short and a very easy read that flows through quite quickly. It could easily be finished in a sitting or two. For a ghost story, I'd say this is one of the most heart warming I have ever read.",
            "Although I personally could definitely very much do without rather volatile and immature emotionally wise neighbour girl Kristi (as she remains annoyingly undeveloped character-wise and also rather seems to be tacked on as a somewhat too predictable plot device to infuse the plot with action and conflict to move it along), I have indeed still quite enjoyed Mary Downing Hahn's The Doll in the Garden: A Ghost Story, as it presents a creepily spooky but in my opinion also never actually all that frightening ghost infused Middle Grade tale, alongside of important messages regarding illness, friendship, forgiveness and death. And to and for me, with The Doll in the Garden: A Ghost Story, of primary necessity and importance is the all encompassing lesson that feeling anger and even resentment at a loved one or a friend who has died is indeed an often natural occurrence and even a manner of potentially coping, but that this nevertheless also needs to be discussed, that especially when like with the main protagonist's case, like with young Ashley, a parent has died, not discussing this, trying to somehow push the painful reality of this away from family conversations and such does nothing but cause emotions, sadness, anger and yes even guilt to fester and rankle internally, inside of one's heart and soul, a scenario that is then mirrored in The Doll in the Garden: A Ghost Story by what had occurred in the past between Cassie and Louisa. And how only by going back in time and into her own girlhood to when Louisa was dying, old and cantankerously bitter Miss Cooper is able find peace, can finally forgive herself and can find some real happiness (and to say her final goodbyes to Louisa, as well as return the absconded doll), an ending that is both sweet and satisfying, although I do have to admit that at first, I was a bit like Ashley rather upset that returning the lost/stolen doll to Louisa does not in fact make her strong enough to successfully fight against her tuberculosis, that she still ends up dying of consumption. But truthfully, I do realise that the ending of The Doll in the Garden is actually pretty well perfect as to the author's, as to what I consider Mary Downing Hahn's intentions have been (namely to show and present the importance of forgiveness, to demonstrate that while anger and resentment at a death are definitely natural feelings, they are also emotions that need to be discussed and dealt with in order for the departed to find peace and rest, for with what Ashely has experienced with Louisa Perkins and Cassie Cooper, she is then also able to use this to discuss her father's recent cancer death with her mother and to admit that she often has felt not only sadness at his passing but also actual anger towards him for dying, for leaving her alone and heartbroken). A fast, emotionally evocative, stirring and sweet read is The Doll in the Garden: A Ghost Story, and while for me, the issues with the inclusion of Kristi as a character (as a plot device of not much nuance and development character wise) do indeed make me only consider a three star maximum ranking for The Doll in the Garden: A Ghost Story, I will still highly recommend Mary Downing Hahn's narrative as a lovely and evocative little ghost (as well as time slip) tale, perfect for tween readers who might desire a bit of an eerie reading experience but one that is also and at the same time not too creepy (and furthermore deals with important life and philosophy of existence lessons and messages).",
            "This was a cute little ghost story about forgiveness and letting go. Having lost my grandma to cancer in an untimely manner, I was able to relate to Ashley and the guilt and anger she felt after her father's death. I never thought she would actually die, and how the author portraits these feelings in The Doll in the Garden is truly wonderful. This story is about how childhood relationships and feelings of guilt and grief that were not dealt with can turn someone into a bitter and angry person. And how getting stuck in the past and not moving on can ruin an entire life. I loved this short story. I loved the childhood innocence in its pages. I wish all children could be spared from loss and sadness",
            "Obviously I make these ratings based on how I felt about the book at the time that I read it. So, the 4 out of 5 stars is the rating that the 11 year old me would have given it. I remember loving this book, and I remember checking it out from the school library more than once, which is something I don't now or didn't then do very often. The only part of it I remember is the beginning when she and her mom ate pizza on the front porch. But it has stuck with me long enough so I had to add it to my books. I think any young girl would like it.",
            "Lately I've been starting to read this author. Turns out that The Doll in the Garden fits one of my favorite themes, that of Inter-generational Friendship, perfectly. It's a ghost story, ok... or it could easily be redefined as a time travel story... but the deeper themes are all about being never too old (or too young) to learn how let go of regrets re' the loss of a loved one. Very quick read, well-done, universal and timeless.",
            "Reread 2018: It's clear why the book is so memorable and is considered a classic amongst people of a certain age: it's well-written, centers around a living ghost story, and stars a protagonist who is new to the neighborhood and is feeling alienated and out-of-sorts since her dad died. The story is incredibly imaginative. I'd love to know how Mary Hahn came up with the concept of a doll shared between two girls at two different times, and which caused a lifelong bitterness in Carrie (Miss Cooper). Reading it as an adult, it's a subtle reminder of what we all know so well: that the things which occur in childhood have a lasting impact on our lives and form and shape the very people we become, our fears, our vulnerabilities, our likes and dislikes - including the stories we read and the characters with whom we grow up. While the story didn't knock my socks off (I more appreciated rather than enjoyed it), my memories of the book from childhood were instantaneous. And seeing the cover, with Anna Maria and Snowball, I was knocked back 20-something years. I love that feeling.* * *Cannot believe I found this in a used book store in Tel Aviv! What a rush of memories. I had completely forgotten about this book, but just catching a glimpse at the title, the story came crashing back to me. I can't wait to reread this one. (And I'm pleasantly surprised at how many reviews it has on GR; I thought it was obscure!)",
            "Purchased at the local library sale table for .10, this was a quick, nothing of substance read. Attempting to read my huge stash of books before purchasing more, I happened to grab this off the shelf.When Ashlee and her mother move to the upstairs apartment of a bitter, nasty elderly woman, Ashlee roams the back yard gardens while her mother types away, preparing to finish her education in order to support the family.Finding a play mate, together they discover a Victorian doll buried in the woods. As both children hear cries of a young girl during the night, Ashlee travels deep into the woods to discover a very ill girl who lived and died a long, long time ago.Through a series of visits, Ashlee and her friend learn that the doll was taken by her friend and she would like to reclaim it. The girls put the pieces together to learn that the bitter landlady was the long-ago friend who took the doll.This is a story of grief and redemption. As Ashlee allows the tears to flow for her father who died of cancer, the landlady visits the woods, goes back in time and not only returns the doll, but has the opportunity to say goodbye to her friend who died of consumption.Again, nothing earth shattering, but I can claim that one more book is off the tbr pile, and will be given away to the library where I purchased it.",

Can an old woman forgive herself and begin to live again? Can a little girl come to terms with the losses in her life?",
            "this book is a perfect example of don't judge a book by it's cover. i found the book and instantly said oh Chucky is a doll so this must be creepy or about a killer doll. but by the last few chapters i could not stop crying. the book is so mentally depressing that i almost had to put the book down, which for me is very bad. i would not tell others that this book is good for the soul because its very sad. but it is excellently written and that is why i love it.",

Why is the little girl crying, why does the cat come out at night to the old lady's yard?It's not until almost 11yr. old Ashley and her Mom move to the upstairs floor of the old lady's house when Ashley and her 7yr. old new neighbor Kristy start playing in the back garden and discover a buried box with a porcelain doll inside it. Whom did this doll belong to? and who wrote the note buried inside with It?I loved the way the cat was the messenger and the gateway through both worlds and how the author of the note honored a 72yr. old broken promise and mistake.I cried, the loss and grief everybody is trying to overcome is a bit strong but well handled.

            "This ghost story freaked me out REALLY BADLY as a child.",
            "It was a very amazing book, but at some parts, I almost cried. I read it in one day! I just couldn't put it down! I kept on wondering, What will happen? I gotta know!",
            "This is more of a fantasy book than a ghost story. Also the plot is very obvious if you have read Downing's novels before. ",

        "description": "This is the dramatic story of J. P. Donleavy's personal struggle to create and publish a book that became a twentieth-century masterpiece: The Ginger Man. It is literary history combined with Donleavy's autobiography - from his childhood in the Bronx, education at Catholic schools, service in the U.S. Navy, and travels, to his current life as proprietor of a landed estate in the midlands of Ireland. Trinity College in Dublin after World War II was a mecca for adventurous Americans who used the G.I. Bill as a passport to higher education. Among them were able-bodied seaman second class J. P. \"Mike\" Donleavy, fighter pilot George Roy Hill (now a celebrated Hollywood director), and naval yeoman Gainor Stephen Crist, a midwestern rara avis and model for the Ginger Man. Student life included degrees in debauchery; drunken brawls in Dublin pubs; comic capers with the playwright Brendan Behan; eccentric Anglo-Irish aristocrats; living on miraculous credit and in constant debt with plenty of time for the seduction of nice Catholic girls. Donleavy, impecunious and newly married, began to write The Ginger Man in a primitive isolated cottage at Kilcoole. He completed the book over a period of four years on two continents. The Ginger Man was rejected by nearly thirty-five American and British publishers. The book was finally published in Paris in 1955 by Maurice Girodias of the Olympia Press as a work of pornography. Twenty-five years of bitter litigation between Donleavy and Girodias followed, with Donleavy emerging triumphant as sole owner of Olympia and its copyrights, including that of The Ginger Man. Since its traumatic birth, The Ginger Man has become a contemporary classic, translated intomany languages, with millions of copies sold throughout the world.",

            "The main protagonist, Sebastian Dangerfield, is a feckless, articulate, poetic drunkard who somehow has a roguish charm about him (though you wouldn't want to be saddled with the spiteful ne'er-do-well; he's best viewed from afar). The Irish badinage is indecorously funny and the 'stream-of-consciousness' prose is masterly. Those readers whose sensibilities are easily offended by make-believe misogyny in a fictional novel might want to give it a wide berth.",
            "Review \u2013 The Ginger Man \u2013 28 May 2013\u201cWhen you get back Kenneth, I\u2019ll walk naked wearing a green bowler to greet you at the boat. With a donkey cart flying green streamers and green shamrocks imported from Czechoslovakia and a band of girl pipers blowing like mad. Did you know that they imported the English sparrow into America to eat horseshit off the streets?\u201dWho else, but an Irish writer, and a zany one at that, could possibly have written that?It\u2019s interesting to know, however, that when \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d was published in Paris in 1955, it was simultaneously banned in Ireland. It was considered obscene at the time and it typically took the all-embracing French to appreciate it for its sensual and literary worth.Yes, I did find it slightly risqu\u00e9 when I first read it but then that was twenty or so years ago and so returning to \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d after this gap, has been a shock, to put it mildly, to my system. I recall that previously I sailed through it, appreciating it for the Irish dry sense of humor, the nonchalant air of the poverty-stricken protagonist, Sebastian Dangerfield, and the atmosphere of Dublin in the late forties. I was so impressed by it in fact that I immediately purchased another five of his books:\u201cThe Onion Eaters\u201d\u201cA Singular Man\u201d\u201cMeet My Maker the Mad Molecule\u201d\u201cThe Saddest Summer of Samuel S\u201d\u201cThe Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B\u201dThey were all pretty comical and wacky, especially \u201cThe Onion Eaters\u201d but basically the best one was \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d. Why is it, I ask myself, that so many authors write a magnificent first novel and then the following ones never seem to live up to the initial expectations?But now, reading this book, I\u2019m viewing it completely differently; if anything it\u2019s more the style as opposed to the plot which really cannot be called too exciting and which regrettably doesn\u2019t enthrall me to turn the page, and read and read, without putting it down until the end. It has a writing style, however, that is quite unique, and I would imagine very difficult to do, that of swinging from the first to the third person and back via the main character, Sebastian Dangerfield. That is either very clever or extremely foolish but it suits the style of this book.An example is:\u201cO\u2019Keefe sauntered sadly off and disappeared down this gray dark street called Seville Place. Dangerfield walked back across Butt Bridge, a finely divided rain falling. My body has blue joints. Ireland is heaven bound with this low weather...And clusters of men hunched in black overcoats sucking cigarettes, spitting and mean. With tongues of shoes hanging out like dogs\u2019 hungry mouths. I\u2019d give anything for a drink now.\u201dWho but J. P. Donleavy could have started his book with the first three mini paragraphs:\u201cToday a rare sun of spring. And horse carts clanging to the quays down Tara Street and the shoeless white faced kids screaming.O\u2019Keefe comes in and climbs up on a stool. Wags his knapsack around on his back and looks at Sebastian Dangerfield.Those tubs are huge over there. First bath for two months (note from me: let me stay a mile from him \u2013 I imagine that he would be \u201cwell cooked\u201d). I\u2019m getting more like the Irish every day. Like going on the subway in the States, you go through a turnstile.\u201dStrange turns of phrase run throughout the book but what a helter-skelter of a ride has this turned out to be. One moment I think that Sebastian is a ghastly fellow. He appears to be such an unsavory, unclean, unreliable, Irish-American, who really doesn\u2019t seem to know which country he belongs to \u2013 Ireland or America; who is constantly on the lookout for sexual pursuits and imbibing copious amounts of alcohol. Worst of all, he\u2019s a liar to all intents and purposes. Then a few paragraphs or chapters later on, he becomes funny, gentle, endearing, picaresque, full of the blarney and a pleasure to read. There\u2019s a certain mockery about him too and yet also a poignant side.I feel for his long suffering wife Marian, who tries so hard to make a go of this marriage but our dear Sebastian had no idea how to behave with her and even fantasizes and thinks of another woman, Ginny Cupper, when he\u2019s making love to her. Ah yes, she \u201ctook me in her car out to the spread field of Indiana\u201d.I actually think I would have tossed him out with a flea in his ear!To help their financial problems, Miss Lilly Frost comes to live with them. Marion finally, however, gives up on her husband\u2019s feckless behavior and takes the child Felicity back to Scotland. Does Dangerfield appear to miss her? Not really, just the convenience of having her around, like a well-heeled shoe.His attitude towards money counts for naught. What decent man who has been left money by his wife to pay the bills, would spend it and in addition hock their fire. His well-spoken American friend, Kenneth O\u2019Keefe, with delusions of grandeur, also deserves a boot up the backside. Such a clever, amusing, unclean, complex individual and also thoroughly unlikeable but then he also turns up trumps in that he\u2019s so amusing from time to time. What a contradictory book this is turning out to be. He constantly admonishes Sebastian about his bad drinking habits:\u201cThis, Dangerfield, is your blood for which your family will starve and which will finally send you all to the poor house. Should have played it cozy and married strictly for cash. Come in drunk, have a quick one and whoops, another mouth to feed\u2026\u201dOther girls/women such as Chris, Mary and Miss Frost all love him to death, feed him, not only by giving him their food or money but also physically. He\u2019s a taker and the remarkable thing is that he gets away with it; his stealth in his creepy, sly way of getting into Miss Frost\u2019s bed and the guilt after the event. Her wish to confess to the priest because this sexual act was a mortal sin.And yet the hypocrisy:\u201cLilly, why did you want me to do it this way?\u201d\u201cO Mr Dangerfield, it\u2019s so much less of a sin.\u201d\u201cAnd fun too.\u201dStill Sebastian always manages to extricate himself from his involved, convoluted relationships with women and yet he goes off to London with Mary and \u2026.well that\u2019s for you to find out.And finally, on being viewed by other people:\u201cOn O\u2019Keefe\u2019s head a brown dirty tweed cap. Women in this lounge looking at the two of them with their legs stretched all over the place. And they were cocking their white ears to hear that bearded man go on about such fantastic things with that awful accent of his and who is that man with his haughty ways and county voice, flicking his fingers exquisitely and rolling back his head to belch laughter. So sure of themselves.\u201dIn conclusion, am I pleased that I reread this book? Well, yes and no. There\u2019s a strange kind of brilliance to it that I didn\u2019t feel the first time around but the criticism I do have, of myself anyway, is my ambivalent feeling here. This was definitely the best of all his books but nevertheless I think my reading style is now going in a different direction. I\u2019m more into a good plot, sensitivity in the writing style, one that flows but with a touch of exotic spices and flavors thrown in, combined with musical elements that enthrall me; a book to entice and whet the appetite; to try and venture out and experience all; laughs and thrills too I guess. But the most important aspect is that of unexpected anticipation\u2026 That says it all. Whatever one says about this book, it certainly remains in the mind and I\u2019m intrigued to know for how long.",
            "The lyrical quality of money is strange.- J.P. Donleavy",
            "Beautiful. For all those 1 and 2 star reviewers on here who hated the book for its misogyny and the unpleasantness of Sebastian",
            "Before starting this novel, it would be helpful to review two definitions:1. Satire: the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.2. Picaresque: of or relating to an episodic style of fiction dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero.I started reading The Ginger Man without reviewing those principles and nearly quit in disgust. Even after getting those concepts clear in my head, I was able to merely tolerate the main character. Sebastian Dangerfield is truly a bastard, totally consumed with drinking, smoking, eating, and seducing women, all while doing absolutely no work (or study) and paying as few bills as possible. In other words, I had great difficulty with seeing him as an appealing main character.You\u2019ve probably run into one of these characters at some point in your life\u2014if he would just put as much effort into a job as he puts into avoiding getting a job, he would have the money that he so desperately desires. Those of us who live responsible lives watch these cads with fascination and revulsion\u2014most of us wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the mental strain that they navigate on a daily basis, leading me to believe that they are either narcissists or sociopaths, who simply don\u2019t feel the responsibilities of civilized life in the way that most of us do. [Wikipedia informs me that this book is reputedly semi-autobiographical for Donleavy, making me wonder what kind of person he is].I\u2019ve also read a later book of Donleavy\u2019s, The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B, which is somewhat different in tone. Balthazar is a somewhat more sympathetic character, portrayed as a confused victim in life, manipulated by those around him (somewhat like O\u2019Keefe in The Ginger Man). But Balthazar\u2019s friend Beefy is another version of Dangerfield. I\u2019m also curious about the title, The Ginger Man. It is never explained and Dangerfield doesn\u2019t refer to himself as the ginger man until page 255 and not again until the very last page. If the cover is any indication, it refers to Dangerfield\u2019s hair colour, as he is illustrated as a red head. So that remains a bit of a question in my mind.Part of my issue, I am sure, is that I am female and tend to identify with the women in the novel. I was frustrated with their behaviour as well. Why in the world would his wife leave Sebastian a forwarding address the first time she left him? And those single women whom Sebastian seduces\u2014what in the world do they see in him? I want to shake each and every one of them!One of my female friends recommended Donleavy\u2019s writing to me and I chose this book because it was on the Modern Library\u2019s list of 100 top novels. Obviously other people find it amusing and worthwhile to read. I cannot count myself among them, however, despite the skillfulness of the writing. I think this is the last Donleavy work that I will read. There are too many books that I\u2019m sure I will enjoy to spend my valuable reading time on this author.",

            "How important is it for the reader to like the central protagonist of a novel? Obviously if one is going to spend hundreds of pages in \u2013 or around \u2013 a character\u2019s head, then it is preferable to empathise with him or her. However there are some books, Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u2018Notes From Underground\u2019 say, where clearly we are not supposed to like the central character and yet the passion of the prose is such that we can\u2019t help but admire the work anyway.These thoughts were high in my mind as I read \u2018The Ginger Man\u2019. Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield is an American with an English accent who drinks, carouses and swindles his way through Dublin and London. His behaviour is mostly atrociously selfish and sometimes seems to spring from a deep-set maliciousness, and yet (sort of Spoiler Alert!) he faces no great comeuppance at the end and one gets the impression that if his story was picked up a year later it would be much the same. He staggers, shagging and arguing, from one grim situation to the next, leaving a trail of gullible women injured in his wake. And are we supposed to like him for this? Are we supposed to be amused by his exploits and smile at what an uncontrollable rogue he is? Or, if we are occasionally amused by the set-pieces which arise from his actions, do we chuckle with a little shudder? Do we congratulate ourselves on (hopefully) never having run into such a person?To be fair it is brilliantly written and there are some laugh out loud moments within these pages. But whereas a book like \u2018Notes From Underground\u2019 is a character study where the reader is supposed to dislike the character, I think \u2018The Ginger Man\u2019 wants the reader to be on Dangerfield\u2019s side. And if you\u2019re not in Dangerfield\u2019s side then it is like looking through a window at some dreadfully reprehensible party and being immensely glad that you\u2019re not part of it.",
            "#99 on the Modern Library Board's List. Published in 1955. If there's a reason people don't succeed in working through the Modern Library backwards, it's probably this. The Ginger Man is a novel for no one",
            " this is # 99 on my list of 100. i received the greatest joy when i read the last page and didn t have to spend any more time with ,sabastian. is this a great novel cause donleavy describes in great detail one of the worst characters in literature ? he is cruel to women and yet they keep coming back to him. he doesn t work, barely studies his law books, has no redeeming qualities. he reminds me of the college drunks who wasted their education in college. there are so many bad books on this list of 100 that i might stop reading the list.",
            "Sometimes I am absolutely baffled as to why certain books are on the Modern Library Top 100 book list. This is certainly one of those. Sebastian Dangerfield is an American studying law at Trinity College in Dublin just after WWII, married and with a daughter, and with a serious drinking problem and a really, really bad attitude. He is a 100% unredeemable character, beating and humiliating his wife and trying to smother his daughter in one of his rages. He very occasionally studies or goes to his classes, but more often is found at the local pubs and fighting with others like him. He has no money, his house is a horror, he sleeps with other women and lies to every one who comes in contact with him.I don't enjoy characters who feel a sense of entitlement, and Sebastian clearly feels he deserves more than he is willing to work for. Somehow the women in his life are completely entranced by him and keep coming back - his wife is probably the smartest of them all, but even she stuck around entirely too long. Sebastian Dangerfield is the same sort of character as Ignatius Reilly in A Confederacy of Dunces, another book which is hailed as being brilliant that I could not stand. I expect characters in books to have some sort of quality that I would hope to find in a real person. Even if they are disgusting creatures throughout most of the novel",
            "Poetry and smut. What more could you ask for?",
            "The book is described as a \u201ccomic masterpiece\u201d and it\u2019s odd because when I think back to a couple events in the novel, like the toilet paper robbery and the landlord Skully knocking at his window, they seem funny. (The bit of amusement I felt after reading the scene about Skully at the window faded quickly.) But while reading the thing? I laughed only once, and it wasn\u2019t something Sebastian did or said at all but part of a letter he received from his friend in America: This is America and we out-produce"

            "When I grow up, I want to be like Danny Wallace! Because here is a man who has carved out a career for himself still doing all the things you might drunkenly discuss and laugh about whilst in the pub, but would then never actually do when you came to your senses the morning after. But looking at Danny Wallace\u2019s back-catalogue of books and you see that not only is he the man that still carried out these immature boy tasks, but he has wrote a whole bunch of books of them. I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised, he is the Yes Man after all...To read the rest of this review please visit my blog:http://stevenscaffardi.blogspot.co.uk...",
            "Dear Daniel Wallace,I won your book in a Goodreads Giveaway. I enter any giveaway where the synopsis seems halfway interesting.First, I must take you to task for the book jacket. It looks awful, like a scrap-booking mishap, with photos of people that will mean nothing and make no impact on anyone who hasn't already read the book.I must also take umbrage with your hyperbolic quotes: Irresistible - Daily Mail No part of this book defies resistance. It's slow paced",
            "Impressed. The comedy is always there in a Wallace book and he manages to slip in some humanity too. There's usually something a little heartbreaking but it's always a great story. Really liked it.",
            "Such a funny book! A great (true) story of the hilarious Danny Wallace trying to get in contact with his old childhood friends. Only gave it 4 stars because I felt it was a little bit slow at times and it didn't quite have the heart-warming life-affirming effect of Yes Man.",
            "How could you resist a title like that? It\u2019s friendly (har har), engaging, and describes the book down to a T. As his 30th birthday approaches, Wallace begins to really feel the transition from boy to man, and fears it. By chance, his parents send him a box full of photos and random objects from his childhood, including an old address book. An idea dawns on him: Why not hunt down these old friends and see how they\u2019re handling adulthood?The journey that ensues is hilarious, both in Wallace\u2019s antics and the ways in which he describes them. He\u2019s got the witty writing down pat, and you\u2019ll no doubt snort a few times (er, not that I did), like when he travels all the way from London to L.A. to carry out a practical joke.This is the kind of book that most likely will not exist in the future as we grow more and more connected through technology. Now that children are growing up with Facebook and email, they will be able to maintain some semblance on contact, even if they move away or go to different schools. Part of me thinks it\u2019s great, in that we don\u2019t ever have to lose touch. But then can we truly enjoy the magic of catching up after a long time apart? Or is it just awkward to one day decide to message your kindergarten friend with whom you\u2019ve been \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook for the past seven years?",
            "This feels a little bit like he\u2019s running out of ideas for what wacky adventure he can get him self mixed up in next while trying to live up to the truly excellent \u2018Join Me\u2019 and entirely original \u2018Yes Man\u2019. Not to mention that is some parts it just feels a little contrived. These minor criticisms aside \u2018Friends like These\u2019 is still a very enjoyable read. It is also heart warming and life affirming in that it demonstrates that while a friendship may well be lapsed it\u2019s never lost and reconnecting with old pals can be truly rewarding. Not to mention as with all his books, the basic message is that life is for living and taking risks often brings rewards. One thing that did irk me quite a bit was his over reliance on italics for emphasis. I mean the fella use it a lot!",
            "Turning 30 is more than a looming milestone for Danny Wallace in this book about his search for his childhood friends after his mother sends him a box of keepsakes from his early years. His quest to reestablish contact with twelve of his long lost friends is filled with humor, self-doubt and a touch of sadness. I give it four stars for humor, two for overdoing the seriousness of becoming a man and three for the insight of recognizing and propounding the importance and benefits of maintaining friends and reconnecting with those in our past.He does travel to Ireland",
            "What a damn good idea! Setting out to meet up with the friends you had in primary school, to prove that even though you haven't seen each other for many years, you're still friends at heart! Thanks Danny - geez I really appreciate your work and the honesty you convey. I wish you were one of my primary school besties, I do. And I really wish I'd met you when you wrote part of this in New Zealand. What more can I say except...well...POTATOO!!!"

            "This book started out good enough. But less than halfway through I could not stand the characters. I liked Aimee when I first started reading because she is this strong, independent woman that has proven herself capable of achieving anything she has set her mind to and does not take any crap from anyone, let alone a man. Nicolo I never liked; he is a chauvinistic pig and a borderline misogynist whose mentality and attitude towards women is that of man who existed in Medieval society. He has no respect for women period! He is controlling to the point of being very close to abusive. Not to mention he uses sex as a means of ultimate control and forced submission. He is exactly the kind of man I could not see woman like Aimee even tolerating for less than half a second. That is why when she falls in love with him it is totally unbelievable. This is a man that forced himself on her",
            "This was one of Sandra's earlier books and it was really a good read. It is the story of a prince, Nicolo, and an american girl Aimee. Aimee's father owns his own business and Aimee was grooming herself to one day take over, but her father doesn't think a woman has any business being at the head of a company so he doesn't even consider him. Nicolo goes to her father hoping to buy his company. Her father comes up with the idea to keep the company in the family, if he marries his daughter then he gets the company. Well as you can tell this is not a successful proposition. It has Nicolo and Aimee both furious. Join in the fun on go on an adventure with them both as you read this book. I know you will enjoy it as much as I did.",
            "Review to come and it was hot and sweet! ",
            "Amazing is the only way to describe The Italian\u2019s Pregnant Bride. From the very moment, I began reading Nicolo and Aimee\u2019s story I knew I was in for an exceptional read. The emotion, passion and attraction these two people feel for each other will have you burning the midnight hours away as I promise you will not be able to put this book down. This is the first book in Sandra\u2019s Billionaire Brides trilogy and if every male character is as charismatic as Nicolo, then the reader is in for sensational entertainment. You get a glance of each of this European princes\u2019 and find they are old school friends, all wealthy, talented, sinfully handsome and have no interest in marriage. Both of these characters so very dynamic, especially Aimee Black, who one learns later is the granddaughter to James Black the very man Nicolo is to meet later that week. Nicolo is on a mission to add a New York bank to his empire, which he felt, would be his crown jewel. Therefore, he has travelled to Manhattan to meet with James Black. On his way his hotel, he literally bumps into a stunning woman who is so \u201cprickly\u201d and bad tempered that he kisses her in order to silence her\u2026..had he gone mad? Later, he runs into her at a \u201cprivate club\u201d owned by a friend and shares an evening of passion with this mystery woman. She flees in the morning and he has absolutely no idea of her identity. Aimee has haunted him because of her insults and not accepting his apology. As he gets to know her he admires her defiance, her passion, her determination, fire and courage.As luck would have it, he sees her again at the bank meeting and a bomb is dropped on both of them\u2026\u2026James Black wants a union, a marriage if the sale is to go though. On top of everything else, Aimee learns she is carrying Nicolo\u2019s child, a result of their night of passion. Of course being the strong alpha male he demands that they marry to give his heir the Barbieri name.Aimee lost her parents at a young age, had never felt loved by her grandfather who raised her upon her parents death. She had always tried to prove herself and was in hopes of someday being promoted to the top to replace her grandfather at the helm of the privately owned and prestigious bank Stafford-Coleridge-Black. Aimee appears to be a strong person but underneath she was lonely and my heart ached for her especially when she realized she had left herself behind and began to ponder what she might have been\u2026\u2026This is where their journey begins\u2026.it\u2019s such an unbelievable rollercoaster ride it will have you crying, your heart thumping and anxious to learn more about these two wonderful people. Sandra Marton has yet again, written a beautiful and entertaining story and for me, it will go on my top ten list for 2007.Book Description:He had to have her, from the moment he saw her. No names, no strings, no seeing her ever again\u2026\u2026.It was payday for Prince Nicolo Barbieri. The Italian aristocrat's negotiations to take over Manhattan's SCB bank were about to bear fruit. But he wasn't expecting Aimee Black, granddaughter of the bank's current owner\u2014 who was pregnant with Nicolo's baby! Nicolo felt duty bound to marry Aimee and give his child his name. But Aimee had other ideas about surrendering herself to this arrogant foreigner, who surely didn't love her! ",
            "If I could describe this book with one word, the word would be *Intense*. The passion burned like a wild fire between Nicolo and Aimee. The chemistry was red hot and steamy, and the fights were just as intense. There were times I thought Nicolo was an arrogant jerk, but he changed in a good way throughout the book. This was one intense romance.Sample from chapter 5 \u2013 Whatever the reason, he\u2019d wanted to believe that the woman with the violet eyes had felt the same uncontrollable hunger he had felt. That she could no more have kept from making love with him than she could have stopped breathing. That what had happened that night was the most exciting memory of her life, and that they had created that memory with equal passion and desire. Another sample from chapter 5 \u2013 Aimee sat slumped on the sofa in her apartment, face buried in her hands. Her anger was gone, replaced by a terrible emptiness in her heart. \u201cLet me Explain,\u201d Grandfather had said. Explain what? That he\u2019d been willing to sell her to a foreigner to get what he wanted for his precious bank? Sample from chapter 11 \u2013 Aimee. Bright. Articulate. And exasperating. But Dio, what courage she had! Choosing a life she didn\u2019t want, a life that was the opposite of the one he knew she\u2019d desired, because it was the right thing to do. Aimee, who excited him more than any woman he\u2019d known. Was she his destiny? Not that he believed in such things. A man was born in the world. Beyound that, the life he lived was his own. You made choices, walked a path you controlled. Or maybe not. Was there a force people called fate? Did it wait for the chance to scoop you up and put you on a different path? "

The book is simple in that there is not a lot of text to accompany the artwork. The book does not have a plot in the traditional sense. Instead the book can be viewed as one long descriptive sentence. Where once there was a wood",
            "Where Once There Was a Wood by Denise Fleming is an illustrated poem about our vanishing natural environment as affected by suburban sprawl.Frequently repeating the phrase where once while descrbing the animals that once lived on a tract of land",
            "This goes about how one would expect: the animals get kicked out because humans decide they want to live where the animals used to. The illustrations are very unusual, and I could well be wrong but they seem to be made of torn paper, possibly recycled? The story itself is actually one very long sentence, but it lets the reader see various animals in their homes. The supplementary material at the end of the book is what's the standout here (I'd probably give the story/illustrations three stars otherwise) as it includes very detailed instructions on how to help wildlife feel comfortable in your backyard or school, including food suggestions, how to provide water and shelter, lists of plants that provide places to live for animals, and a quite nice biography of other resources to help get started. That is written at a higher level than the book, but it should be understandable with a parent or teacher's help.",
            "The story does not contain a lot a words, but mostly pictures. It's about how forests, or animal habitats, are compromised to build new neighborhoods/cities. It shows different animals and the places that they live in throughout the book. At the end it has a picture of homes and a city where the forest and animals used to be. Would be a good book to read when discussing animal habitats and ecosystems. I believe it could really only be used as an opener for conversation after reading as the storyline is limited, but it does provide plenty of visuals. Students could draw their own pictureor write their alternate ending of what could happen to the animal(s) after the new town was built including a new home it most likely would migrate to.",
            "In this book each page is a different picture of wildlife living in their habitat. The simple text tells what the animals are doing. On the very last page the book explains that where all of this habitat was, there now is 20 houses side by side (I am assuming some kind of housing development). At the end of the book is a bunch of information on how to turn your backyard into habitat for wild animals and critters. ",
            "This book is a perfect example of deforestation and urbanization. There're many ways that this could be tied into classroom lessons. For example, when discussing food webs, you could point out that when the trees were chopped down, many of the animals probably had to adapt or move away in order to find something to fill the missing spot in their food web. This story with beautifully illustrated and has a nice flow with the wording.",
            "This thoughtful reflection on how building and development by humans effects animal habitats has wonderful and full illustrations from front to back. The back matter, including welcoming wildlife and backyard habitats, has a lot of useful information which adds to the book. This book would introduce students to animals they may be familiar or unfamiliar with such as pheasants and waxwings. It is useful for connecting nature to our own backyard.",
            "The illustrations for this book are so rich in texture, depth and color. It is easy to get lost in the illustrations of the wood. But there is one phrase that keeps pulling me out of the wood -- Where once there was. Because I know as I'm reading this book to my son that all the wonderful things that we see depicted in the illustrations are no more. This is a beautiful, thoughtful book, and a great way to introduce of the topic of development vs. preservation. ",

The author brings some great suggestions about how to create a wildlife habitat for even very small animals in your area. The illustrations are amazing papercuts and really beautiful!",

The students can even mimic the art in the book by using paper mache and paint to create healthy environments for plants and/or animals.Recommended grade level: K-5.",

They can then create a graphic organizer listing a few facts that happen during deforestation and other facts. ",

Georg G. Iggers traces the basic assumptions upon which historical research and writing have been based, and describes how the newly emerging social sciences transformed historiography following World War II. The discipline's greatest challenge may have come in the last two decades, when postmodern ideas forced a reevaluation of the relationship of historians to their subject and questioned the very possibility of objective history. Iggers sees the contemporary discipline as a hybrid, moving away from a classical, macrohistorical approach toward microhistory, cultural history, and the history of everyday life. The new epilogue, by the author, examines the movement away from postmodernism towards new social science approaches that give greater attention to cultural factors and to the problems of globalization.",

            "What Happened, and Why?It took me just over a year to finish the Historiography textbook not because it wasn\u2019t interesting or useful, but because this was the book I kept in my bag and pulled out to read when I had an odd hour sitting on a train, or in a waiting room, or before a meeting started. It was always the \u201cother\u201d book I was reading, and I finished it in chunks, often a paragraph at a time.I picked it up last summer because I was about to begin teaching high school History courses for the first time in my career after having been an English teacher for the previous 9 years. I wanted a more thorough grounding in the history of History, so to speak. How had the interpretation of events in the past changed over time?The answer is that, in the 20th century, it went from grand scale explanations to micro size interpretations. History as a discipline was always narrative in nature, but sought for objective explanations of events in the past. It was thought at one point that history was a process which led to an inevitable outcome, yet this idea becomes problematic over time.In the last century, History writers first focused on key figures\u2014kings, presidents, charismatic leaders. As time went on, writers began to center the nation-state as the central figure of History. The history of the world was a history of the development of its countries. This eventually gave way to a more institutional interpretation of events; History was less about important people in important countries, more about the important structures in important countries. After all, what is a nation-state but a complex system of institutions like the economy, government, and the various classes of people? Of course, this gave way to the idea of a history from below. This is the argument that regular individuals with independent values comprise these systems, and so regular people must be at the center of history. Yet this leads to a more social science and cultural anthropological consideration of the past, and lends History as a discipline to more subjective interpretations than objective reports of what happened, and why. All of this, plus the post-modern literary notion that language is a self-referencing system and the words we write in a narrative explanation cannot reflect an outside reality, and it becomes difficult to know whether or not we can actually understand history to a degree that it can still be called true.This is pretty much where we find ourselves at the start of the 21st century.This book was challenging and engaging. It\u2019s not light reading by any means, and I\u2019m still left with questions. For instance, is there a theory of history that we can use to test hypotheses and predictions about events in the world today? Does each iteration of academic writing about History provide useful tools in the teaching of this content, or should the older methods be abandoned entirely? Iggers, using a German precision with his words to relate complicated concepts, does a good job of helping the reader to understand the broad arc of History as a discipline in the 20th century. With that said, I think having someone else to talk with and bounce ideas about the text off of might have helped me reach a 5 star rating. I just don\u2019t think I can get there on my own.",
            "Iggers does an excellent job of putting together a century's worth of historiography into a concise 200 page book. He separates his topics in three different parts. The first deals with the emergence of history as a professional science. He begins with his discription of Leopold Ranke and his aim to turn history into a \u201crigorous science practiced by professionally trained historians\u201d (p. 25). Ranke was responsible in assembling, institutionalizing, successively practicing, and passing on to future historians the core of professional historiography. This advancement legitimized history, successfully making it both a scientific discipline and a source of culture. History would be done by trained professionals and would become more accessible to the public. Part two deals with the social sciences of history and their role in France, Germany, and Marx histories. The influence of the French Annales School of Historians radically modified the conception that history progressed along a one-dimensional timeline from the past to the future. There no longer existed a unified historical development in which a grand narrative, a metahistory, of man could be based. To replace it, French historians theorized that there were in fact three different times: the \u201calmost stationary time of the Mediterranean as a geographic space (longue dur\u00e9e), the slow time of changes in social and economic structures (conjonctures), and the fast time of political events (\u00e9v\u00e9nements)\u201d(p. 57). This method of historiography allowed history from all perspectives; thus the emergence of microhistory. The Annales methodology was broadly influential in leading away from the diplomatic and other forms of political history towards an emphasis on economic and social change focusing on the multiple histories of cultures. For German social history, these historians analyzed the social and economic forces that may shape individuals and social movements. As for the Marxists, they emphasized on the economy and production and how it underpinned the history of social movement. (Apologies for the quick summary...parts of this review was taken from a report I have done for this book; hence the longer segment about the Annales).The third part of Iggers book discusses the viewpoint of the post-modernists and the impact on historical research. According to post-modernists, the truth is dialectical; the search for the truth is an ongoing process. Prominent post-modern historian Hayden White posited that historiography does not diverge from fiction, but that it is a form of fiction (p. 118). White believes that \u201chistorical narratives are verbal fictions, the contents of which are as much invented as found and the forms of which have more in common with their counterparts in literature than they have with those in the sciences\u201d (p. 119). While a rather harsh perspective of White, post-modernist historiography tolerates new opportunities for historians. Historians are able to deconstruct previous histories while adding their own perspectives to historical scholarship. The post-modernist historians reconcile history and the social sciences proffering a new historiography to better interpret the past.All in all, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in historiographical methods that developed during the 20th century. Although it reads more like an annotated bibliography and, in my opinion, a little too harsh on the critique on post-modernist history, it is a well informed book. It encompasses information on numerous historians throughout the twentieth century which provides, as aforementioned, a great bibliography on historiography of the 20th century.",
            "extremely tough to get through but it does give a great overview of the tendencies in modern historical research",
            "Surprisingly readable and engaging history of history, for those who basically are required to read it (because who would really do so otherwise?) \u2013 or have a really, really, really strong love of reading not just history but a history of the doing of history over the past hundred years.But if you're going to read a book like that, this isn't a bad one. It's pretty easy to get through, and Iggers manages mostly to avoid the tendency of these sorts of books to devolve into laundry lists of authors and titles \u2013 although there's plenty of that, too.Mainly, Iggers handily lays out the various schools of history as the profession has changed and democratized over the years, criticizing those he's less enthralled with \u2013 Marxism and postmodern linguistics, here's lookin' at you \u2013 while also praising the tendency toward inclusion and alternate ways of doing history those movements have sparked."

It was good don\u2019t get me wrong, but it wasn\u2019t as extraordinary as the other two. The return of Snakeweed wasn\u2019t the best plot line in my opinion. It seemed like a really similar story of the first book but in reverse."

            "This short book dealing with eschatology is nothing short of amazing. This book is a more accessible reading of some of the discussions and ideas that circulated during the Center of Theological Inquiry's Eschatology Project. This was a interdisciplinary group of scholars - scientists, biblical scholars and theologians - whose task was to reconsider, in the light of modern knowledge, the expression of Christian eschatological hope concerning the end of the world and the fulfillment of the divine purpose for creation. John Polkinghorne is himself a theologian and a scientist and this book will appeal to anyone familiar with the writings of Jurgen Moltmann and Miroslov Volf. If you are a theologian who takes the findings of modern science seriously while at the same time holding to the Christian hope of resurrection you will find this book incredibly informative. His chapter on Personhood and the Soul was worth it alone. He begins with scientific and cultural approaches to eschatology, then moves to biblical evidence, and finally ties it all together with theology. Wonderful book!",
            "It started out great, and got worse and worse. For a book on eschatology, I expected more than three paragraphs of indecision on hell. I had no idea who Polkinghorne was before I read, so without any preconceived notions I was expecting a more traditional Christian perspective (biblically, theologically, historically), but it ended up being very modern, both in its theology and in its writing. It's the sort of writing you might expect at the butt end of an Orwellian tirade. While JP is more well-read and smarter than I, and although it had a few good insights on theology and the modern world, I was quite disappointed.",
            "An excellent book that is now an important one for me and my theology of end times (eschatology). He has a chapter on the resurrection that added a new and important dynamic to my faith. He gives me the passion for a life post-mortem that I will begin to incorporate into my preaching",

        "description": "The essential work on Proust, in a complete English translation for the first time.What is the nature of the search in A la recherche du temps perdu ?It is not quite so simple as the English rendering of the title of Proust's masterpiece: In Search of Lost Time. In a remarkable instance of literary and philosophical interpretation, the incomparable Gilles Deleuze reads Proust's work as a narrative of an apprenticeship-more precisely, the apprenticeship of a man of letters. Considering the search as one directed by an experience of signs, in which the protagonist learns to interpret and decode the kinds and types of symbols that surround him, Deleuze conducts us on a corollary search-one that leads to a new and deeper understanding of the signs that constitute A la recherche du temps perdu..Deleuze traces the network of signs laid by Proust (those of love, art, or worldliness) and moves toward an aesthetics that culminates in a meditation on the literary work as a sign-producing \"machine\"-an operation that reveals the superiority of \"signs of art\" in a world of signs.In Richard Howard's graceful translation, augmented with an essay that Deleuze added to a later French edition, Proust and Signs appears here for the first time in its entirety in English. Admired in its original appearance as an imaginative and innovative study of Proust and as one of Deleuze's more accessible works, Proust and Signs stands as the writer's most sustained attempt to understand and explain the work of art. For what it reveals about both Deleuze and his subject, it remains a source of literary and philosophical insight, inspiration, and surpassing interest.Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was professor of philosophy at the University of Paris, Vincennes-St. Denis. With F\u00e9lix Guattari, he coauthored Anti-Oedipus (1983) and A Thousand Plateaus (1987). Among his other works are Cinema 1 (1986), Cinema 2 (1989), Foucault (1988), The Fold (1992), and Essays Critical and Clinical (1997), all published by the University of Minnesota Press. Richard Howard recently translated The Charterhouse of Parma by Stendhal for the Modern Library and has also translated works by Barthes, Foucault, and Todorov. He teaches in the School of the Arts at Columbia University.",

            "Pour Deleuze, la Recherche n\u2019est pas une entreprise de rem\u00e9moration d\u2019un \u00ab temps perdu \u00bb, mais bien un roman d\u2019apprentissage, un Bildungsroman, o\u00f9 le h\u00e9ros apprend progressivement \u00e0 lire les signes, \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer le monde, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du temps. Proust et les signes est un essai \u00e9crit, lui aussi, dans le temps : on sent assez nettement que Deleuze a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les deux parties de son livre \u00e0 plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u2019intervalle. La premi\u00e8re est un expos\u00e9 quelque peu id\u00e9aliste et, par certains c\u00f4t\u00e9s, assez scolaire, qui rappelle La philosophie critique de Kant, Nietzsche ou Le Bergsonisme. L\u2019argumentation porte sur les diff\u00e9rents r\u00e9gimes de signes, les modalit\u00e9s plurielles d\u2019expression des signes chez Proust : mati\u00e8res, effets, sens, dimensions du temps, essences.En effet, Deleuze \u00e9prouve une fascination pour les \u00e9missions de signes, tout particuli\u00e8rement pour les signes mondains, signes vides, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat intrins\u00e8que, stupides mais souvent comiques, qui sont \u00e9mis \u00e0 des rythmes vari\u00e9s tout au long des interminables chapitres qui, dans la Recherche, d\u00e9crivent les soir\u00e9es et les r\u00e9ceptions dans le petit milieu snob de la haute soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Mais le roman proustien pr\u00e9sente aussi d\u2019autres types de signes, que Deleuze identifie et analyse avec finesse et un certain esprit de syst\u00e8me. Les signes de l\u2019amour \u2014 le plus souvent mensongers ou \u00e9quivoques, voir le geste de Gilberte lors de sa premi\u00e8re rencontre avec le narrateur. Les signes des \u00ab qualit\u00e9s sensibles \u00bb \u2014 telle la fameuse madeleine, qui renvoie \u00e0 un Combray pass\u00e9 ou id\u00e9al. Enfin, les signes de l\u2019art (Vermeer, Vinteuil) qui manifestent, tels des monades leibniziennes, un point de vue singulier et sublime sur le r\u00e9el. Par endroits, l\u2019expos\u00e9 de Deleuze prend des accents platoniciens, voire plotiniens. L\u2019essence des choses \u00ab \u00e9mane \u00bb, se manifeste, s\u2019incarne, s\u2019explique dans le processus d\u2019expression et d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des signes.Plus fondamentalement, Proust et les signes se veut aussi une critique de la th\u00e9orie cart\u00e9sienne de la connaissance, \u00e0 savoir : la connaissance par id\u00e9es claires et distinctes, auxquelles on peut aboutir \u00e0 travers une m\u00e9thode. Pour Deleuze, il s\u2019agit d\u2019abord d\u2019\u00e9tablir que c\u2019est \u00e0 travers les signes, le plus souvent obscurs et confus, opaques, fortuits, involontaires, et sur un mode presque psychanalytique, que se r\u00e9v\u00e8le la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des essences. Ce qui l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure selon une formule proprement freudienne ou nietzsch\u00e9enne : \u00ab Nous avons tort de croire aux faits, il n\u2019y a que des signes. Nous avons tort de croire \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il n\u2019y a que des interpr\u00e9tations. \u00bb (Quadrige, p. 112)Le second moment du livre de Deleuze, cependant (chapitre Antilogos et suivants), est beaucoup plus proche du style herm\u00e9tique et de l\u2019appareil conceptuel des \u0153uvres plus tardives de l\u2019auteur, \u00e9crites en bin\u00f4me avec F\u00e9lix Guattari, notamment L\u2019Anti-\u0152dipe et Mille Plateaux : objets partiels, fragments, \u00e9miettements, articulations, configurations, rapi\u00e9\u00e7ages, agencements, conscience schizo\u00efde, litt\u00e9rature comme machine, production et explication des signes, etc.Deleuze y d\u00e9veloppe de mani\u00e8re foisonnante et jubilatoire des concepts originaux, dont on ne sait pas toujours s\u2019ils donnent \u00e0 penser au sujet du roman de Proust ou, plus franchement, sur la philosophie m\u00eame de Deleuze. On a d\u2019une part, des emboitements ou pliages/d\u00e9pliages (comme des origami) de signes et de contenus \u2014 qui peuvent s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la madeleine ou \u00e0 la sexualit\u00e9 de certains personnages de Proust (Charlus ou Albertine, par exemple). D\u2019autre part, les vases clos contigus non-communicants : homosexualit\u00e9, transsexualisme, hermaphroditisme, combinatoires v\u00e9g\u00e9tales... Le livre de Deleuze se cl\u00f4t sur l\u2019image de l\u2019araign\u00e9e, aveugle, sans organes, qui se tient \u00e0 l\u2019affut des vibrations, des moindres signes \u00e9mis sur sa toile, son rhizome. Signes animaux, signes mondains, m\u00eame diff\u00e9rence.",

            "To say this beats the everloving crap out of the nonsense Alain de Botton wrote on Proust would be among the bigger understatements I unleash this year.",
            "No single writer is more important to the rise of French postmodernity than Marcel Proust, and this is evident in how he has been the subject of philosophical analyses by Derrida, Kristeva, Lacan, Merleau-Ponty, and Deleuze.While I think this is an excellent and imaginative reading of the metaphysics underlying Recherche, this isn't a book that should be read for the sake of understanding Proust. This is not a work where Deleuze helps you understand Proust; it is a work where Proust helps you understand Deleuze.As a precursor to Difference and Repetition, this analysis is surprisingly clear (at least for Deleuze), and he unpacks many of the major themes and ideas that form the core of Difference and Repetition three years later. For anyone familiar with Proust who is hoping to get into Deleuze (which is probably an extremely niche group), this is the book for you.

        "description": "The 21 stories in \"The Springs of Affection\" trace the patterns of love within three middle-class Dublin families, patterns as intricate and various as Irish lace. Love between husband and wife, which begins in courtship and in laughter, loses all power of expression and then vanishes forever. The natural over of sister for brother, of mother for son, is twisted into the rage to possess. And love that gives rise to the rituals of family life grows solid as a rock that will never crumble. In his introduction, William Maxwell, Maeve Brennan's editor at \"The New Yorker,\" writes of the special quality of her stories, of being her friend, and of the premature end of her writing life. In Mr. Maxwell's telling, Maeve Brennan's own story proves as moving as any she ever wrote, and ultimately as heartbreaking.",

            "IL DELTA DELL\u2019AMORE Maeve Brennan il 1 gennaio del 1945 esamina un paio di guanti.The Springs of Affection \u00e8 una raccolta di racconti che usc\u00ec postuma, Maeve Brennan era morta da cinque anni. Questa edizione BUR sembra esserne la traduzione italiana, pur se lascia per strada la maggior parte dei racconti: mancano i racconti iniziali dedicati all\u2019infanzia di Rose; dei sei che raccontano il matrimonio di Rose e Hubert qui ne arrivano solo tre, e gli otto che si concentrano su Delia e Martin scendono ugualmente a tre nell\u2019edizione italiana. Il titolo originale, e anche quello del racconto pi\u00f9 lungo, parla di \u2018affection\u2019, che \u00e8 amore in senso ampio, \u00e8 anche affetto, anche amicizia: sicuramente include l\u2019affetto tra fratelli, l\u2019amore familiare, non solo quello di coppia come invece il titolo italiano e la selezione dei racconti lascerebbe pensare.Infatti, nel racconto pi\u00f9 lungo, quello finale, intitolato proprio The springs of affection, la vera protagonista \u00e8 Min, l\u2019anziana sorella gemella di Martin, unica sopravvissuta alla sua famiglia di origine e a quella che Martin ha costruito con Rose (ma dove sono finite le figlie di Martin e Rose, cos\u00ec presenti nel racconto Storie africane? Una strana dimenticanza da parte di Brennan). Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i (Copenhagen 1864-1916), pittore del silenzio.Min \u00e8 un personaggio indimenticabile, una che si chiede perch\u00e9 i suoi fratelli, cominciando da Martin e proseguendo con le due sorelle minori, si siano sposati invece di restare con la famiglia nella quale sono nati e cresciuti (\u2026stare insieme come una famiglia, allora, come ci era stato insegnato? A un tratto erano diventati molto egoisti e la casa pareva cos\u00ec vuota, come se Martin fosse morto. Dopo il matrimonio non era pi\u00f9 tornato, se non in visita. Abitavano solo dietro l\u2019angolo, ma non era pi\u00f9 la stessa cosa, visto che non dormiva pi\u00f9 nel suo letto.) Il fatto che sia l\u2019ultima superstite e possa vivere ancora per godersi i mobili e gli oggetti che appartengono alla storia matrimoniale di suo fratello Martin e sua moglie Rose, ha l\u2019acuto sapore della vendetta. Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i: Darkened Rooms of Summer.Personalmente ho apprezzato di pi\u00f9 i racconti dove \u00e8 la coppia a essere protagonista, quelli dove sotto la lente di ingrandimento c\u2019\u00e8 l\u2019amore tra una donna e un uomo, e il modo in cui si trasforma col tempo e con le circostanze, l\u2019evoluzione di un matrimonio. Storie da un matrimonio.Liv Ullmann e Erland Josephson in \u201cScene da un matrimonio\u201d di Ingmar Bergman, 1973.Maeve Brennan \u00e8 bravissima a trasformare momenti qualsiasi in passaggi ad alta tensione drammatica nei quali gli aspetti irrisolti, le disfunzioni di un matrimonio esplodono: per esempio, Hubert, rientra in casa e intravede sua moglie Rose chiudere la porta della cucina, e immediatamente capisce che ci sono barriere che vengono erette contro di lui sia in senso letterale che figurato. D\u2019altronde, Hubert \u2026si era innamorato di Rose proprio per le qualit\u00e0 che non possedeva affatto. Da lontano l\u2019aveva vista brillare, ma da vicino quel luccichio si era spento. Brennan \u00e8 bravissima a descrivere quella fase dei matrimoni quando passano da open space a camere separate, quando la condivisione si trasforma in porte chiuse: chiuse da una semplice maniglia - ma la sensazione predominante \u00e8 che invece ci siano giri di chiave e lucchetti e catene, quello che \u00e8 chiuso non si apre pi\u00f9, sarebbe facile, basterebbe un gesto, una mano che si posa sulla maniglia e spinge, una parola o uno sguardo diretto, e invece gli occhi rimangono obliqui o abbassati, le bocche chiuse, cucite, secche, e le mani lontano. Brennan dedica molta cura a descrivere gli interni irlandesi: sono case piene di piccole stanze, di tante porte, di angoli e spigoli e oggetti che bloccano e separano, che rischiano di rompersi tutte le volte, dove l\u2019amore non ha spazio e terreno aperto, ma solo limiti e confini.Brennan sembra pi\u00f9 interessata a come finisce un sentimento piuttosto che a come nasce, pi\u00f9 all\u2019autunno e all\u2019inverno dell\u2019amore che alla primavera, pi\u00f9 alla deriva che alla sorgente.Tindar: Trittico religioni su pagine di Bibbia, Corano e Torah, 2016",
            "Per questa lettura sono in debito con le recensioni di @Orsodimondo e di @Piperitapitta. In genere leggo racconti nei ritagli di tempo, per evitare di dover interrompere la lettura di un romanzo sul pi\u00f9 bello. In questo caso mi sono ritrovata a prolungare la pausa libro e a tagliare il resto. A tenermi incollata alle pagine l\u2019atmosfera a tratti claustrofobica dei racconti della Brennan, grande scrittrice di interni: quelli delle case in cui ambienta le sue storie e quelli della mente di chi li abita. Il mondo esterno esiste solo di sfuggita, intravisto dai giardini curati in modo quasi maniacale, i cui fiori sembrano simboleggiare i colori e i toni che ci si aspettava dalla vita e che la vita ha negato. L\u2019attenzione \u00e8 focalizzata su due coppie, Rose e Hubert nei primi tre racconti, Delia e Martin negli ultimi tre.Tutto ruota intorno alle stanze, ai silenzi che le riempiono come la luce nelle giornate di sole. Poche parole, ripetute automaticamente nei riti quotidiani inevitabili in cui le si incontrano, incapaci di parlarsi e di comprendersi. Per il resto, scambi di sguardi ben diversi da quelli del giorno del matrimonio. Gli occhi di Rose e di Delia sono verdi, melmosi, hanno perso la limpidezza dei primi incontri, spenta dalla quotidianit\u00e0 di madri di famiglia, sottomesse e timorose. Questa incomunicabilit\u00e0 senza remissione trova il culmine della sua espressione nello splendido \u201cL\u2019annegato\u201d in cui, morta Rose, Hubert, che non riesce a piangerla, cerca tracce della sua esistenza e motivi per sentirne la mancanza nella stanza che era stata della moglie, davanti alla quale era passato per tanti anni senza mai entrarvi.E ancora in \u201cIl dodicesimo anniversario di matrimonio\u201d, in cui un vaso di fiori sulla scrivania scatena in Martin l\u2019ennesima, silenziosa crisi di insofferenza nei confronti di Delia.Lucidi e spietati, sono racconti che si leggono tutti d\u2019un fiato, per poi correre fuori in cerca d\u2019aria.Inviato da iPad",
            "Scorci d'interniChe meraviglia!Ho letto solo il primo racconto ed \u00e8 stato come una scossa elettrica, come innamorarsi la prima volta. -------------------Raggelanti, cos\u00ec sono definiti in quarta di copertina i racconti di Maeve Brennan e secondo me non c'\u00e8 aggettivo migliore per descriverli.Solo il primo racconto, quello che mi ha folgorata - ma anche gli altri sono tutti di altissimo livello - lascia intravedere un tiepido raggio di sole, uno di quei raggi che scalda pi\u00f9 alla sola vista che non nella realt\u00e0.Le storie di Maeve Brennan sono storie di coppie, due in questi sei racconti ambientati, come spesso nei suoi scritti, in Irlanda: Rose e Hubert Derdon e Delia e Martin Baggot. Li incontriamo in varie fasi della loro vita, in momenti differenti del loro rapporto e in et\u00e0 differenti: all'inizio della loro storia, con i figli gi\u00e0 grandi, alla morte di uno di loro, ma non c'\u00e8 mai, mai, se non ancora una volta nel primo racconto, uno scambio diretto tra loro; le loro storie sono sempre storie di grandi solitudini, di attese vissute nella speranza di un gesto che non arriva mai, di insofferenza e di insoddisfazione, di ricerca di una parola che potrebbe dare un nuovo corso alle loro vite.Nel primo racconto Rose e Hubert ci fanno sperare in un futuro luminoso, nonostante la loro sia una storia segnata sin dall'inizio dal dramma dell'incomunicabilit\u00e0, incomunicabilit\u00e0 che \u00e8 presente in tutti i racconti e che mina sia il rapporto tra Rose e Hubert che quello tra Delia e Martin; incomunicabilit\u00e0 di cui \u00e8 vittima anche Min, gemella di Martin, che \u00e8 l'io narrante del racconto che d\u00e0 il titolo alla raccolta, quello forse pi\u00f9 sconvolgente per la sua lucida e umana follia. Ci fanno sperare in un futuro luminoso dicevo, e dall'esterno forse, per chi li avr\u00e0 osservati o conosciuti, lo sar\u00e0 stato: una vita insieme, la loro, cos\u00ec come quella dei Baggot.Maeve Brennan per\u00f2 non ci descrive le loro storie esteriori, ma quelle vissute dall'interno da ciascuno di loro, e d\u00e0 voce ai pensieri pi\u00f9 nascosti e alle delusioni pi\u00f9 forti, narrandoci di attese e speranze che non finiscono mai, di giardini e case che con i loro colori e con i loro profumi sembrano essere anch'essi persone vive, di tende azzurre che racchiudono, con la loro storia, una vita intera.La sua scrittura \u00e8 limpida, cristallina, tagliente, perch\u00e9 descrive senza indugiare su particolari inutili, ma allo stesso tempo capace, con pochi tratti, di restituire al lettore una realt\u00e0 ben precisa in cui immergersi, e di trasportarlo in ambienti, atmosfere e situazioni talmente vive, di analisi talmente spietate, da lasciare alla fine spossati per l'intensit\u00e0 e la vividezza delle storie.Quello che stupisce, leggendo la biografia della Brennan, nata a Dublino e cresciuta da quando aveva l'et\u00e0 di sedici anni a New York dove il padre fu primo ambasciatore irlandese e dove poi visse fino alla morte, \u00e8 la sua capacit\u00e0 di ricreare alla perfezione situazioni e ambienti di luoghi nei quali lei stessa aveva vissuto solo per una breve parte della sua vita. Mi viene da chiedermi se sia mai tornata in Irlanda anche se solamente in viaggio e se la sua scelta di ambientare sempre nel suo paese d'origine le sue storie non fosse in fondo un modo per continuare ad abitare quelle stesse case, quelle stesse vie, quelle stesse citt\u00e0. In fondo, come mi \u00e8 capitato di leggere di recente, la propria casa, anche quando non c'\u00e8 materialmente pi\u00f9, resta per sempre un luogo dell'anima al quale ricorrere e nel quale ricercare conforto e sicurezza.Devo ringraziare @SFranz per aver parlato di Maeve Brennan nel gruppo dedicato a Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky ( e per me qualsiasi autore venga accostato a Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky, per qualsiasi motivo, \u00e8 sempre un autore che devo leggere :-))) e, ancora una volta, @m\u00edol m\u00f3r per la sua splendida recensione che non ha fatto altro che convincermi, una volta di pi\u00f9, che dovevo leggere Maeve Brennan.Cos\u00ec come scrissi quando mi capit\u00f2 di leggere Willa Cather (chiss\u00e0 se si conobbero mai in quei pochi anni in cui entrambe vivevano a New York!) \u00e8 una consolazione, per me, sapere che nel panorama letterario mondiale c'\u00e8 ancora cos\u00ec tanto da scoprire e da leggere.",
            "Guarda quanto tempo arriva con te...Sono buoni questi sei racconti, Maeve Brennan \u00e8 brava. Il fatto \u00e8 che io non ne posso pi\u00f9 delle solite storie: mariti e mogli prigionieri di matrimoni tristi, senza amore, che si trascinano per abitudine, per convenzioni sociali\u2026 sono stufa di amori che nascono e appassiscono nel breve spazio di una giornata, di solitudini, di ipocrisie\u2026 Maeve Brennan \u00e8 brava, s\u00ec, per\u00f2 io cercavo il nuovo, l'imprevisto, ma non \u00e8 qui, purtroppo non l\u2019ho trovato.Datemi un lieto fine!

            "This has been on my shelves for almost twenty years and I read in a blur this week-- beautiful prose and insight into domestic life and human nature. Brennan excels at describing the internal workings of an individual mind as well as the way people relate to each other. So Irish and so universal at once. Brought to mind the stories of Edward P. Jones and the Mr Bridge/Mrs Bridge novels as well as the more obvious connections to Irish writers like Joyce, Trevor and more recent writers like Danielle McLaughlin. ",
            "These Maeve Brennan stories are all set in the Ireland she had left behind as a young woman. For many years, Brennan wrote for the New Yorker as a \u2018social diarist\u2019 \u2014 sort of the mid-Twentieth Century equivalent of a blogger \u2014 frequently as the \u2018Long-Winded Lady.\u2019 Now she is better known for her rediscovered short fiction.Elegantly written stories, they are filled with people trapped in bad situations without the knowledge or will to leave them. Disappointing lives are presented with a literary shrug of the shoulders, a voice that can be sweet yet sardonic.There is a desperation in many of the characters here, awkwardly self-conscious people who understand (or think they do) what makes others tick but can not bring that same insight to bear on themselves. The ironic is ever present, or at least waiting around the corner.I will admit that I am not a fan, by and large, of that ironic voice\u2013perhaps because it became ubiquitous in the half-century since Brennan wrote the bulk of these pieces. She certainly got in on the ground floor of Post-Modernism.Although the characters and occurrences here are well observed, there is at times a little too much reliance on describing internal thoughts rather than allowing actions to advance the story. This can impose a certain passivity on the reader, a lack of full engagement with the characters. Too much can be spelled out.None the less, the stories can certainly move one. The best are poignant and effective, and once or twice actually brought this reader to tears (admittedly, not that hard to do). These are, truly, minor masterpieces of the modern short story."

On the surface it is a mere telling of his travels in the East. Underneath it is akin to his Acts of the Apostles. The way he expresses his valuation of the lowliest of people in the slums of Calcutta brings tears to my eyes every time I read this book. Honestly I wouldn't recommend that this be the first of Buscaglia's works you read. Or that you read it all all...unless you are ready for a true teaching on love.",

I like that he lets stories speak for themselves instead of miring them in gobble-dee-gook, and there are some amazing stories about connections between human beings, but it was not as life-changing as the 1970s back cover promised.",
            "The Way of the Bull is more of a travelogue of the author's travels through Asia, from Japan westward to India. Readers are given experiential snapshots of interactions with local people and observations on customs and celebrations. Commentary is kept at a minimum and lessons learned are more inferred. Avid readers or listeners of the author will see some of the source material alluded to in future talks on PBS. Enlightening, but comparatively minimalist when put side-by-side with his other books.",

There really isn't much spirituality in the book, except for the usual we are all one kind of epiphany. There are plenty of much better spiritual journey stories out there. But if you are interested in a man's travels through mostly Asian countries in the 1960's & 70's",
            "This book is the reason I wanted to travel the world. And I did do just that. Leo inspired me to get out there and see the great big world and all the people who are just like me, only different. I learned that everyone really has the same wants and fears- and the Jesus is the answer for everyone. Great book!",
            "This book is about Leo Buscaglia's travels through Asia.

It is the summer of 1939, and the residents of the idyllic Sussex fishing port of Bexham are preparing for war. Beautiful but shy Judy Melton, daughter of a naval hero; her determinedly feckless friend, the social butterfly Meggie Gore-Steward; seemingly demure Mathilda Eastcott, and Rusty Sykes, the tomboy daughter of the owner of the local boatyard, are all in their very individual ways determined to play an active part in the defense of their country. But knitting socks and bomb-dodging are not what they have in mind. Under the tree on the green the women of Bexham meet to look back on a landscape that has changed irrevocably, and which they have in their own ways helped to alter. None of them are the same, and yet, with the men returning from war, they are expected to slip back into their simple roles of mother, daughter, grandmother. This, more than anything perhaps, is their greatest sacrifice. Only the chestnut tree planted by Corrie at the edge of the village flourishes in the accepted manner, finally becoming the uniting symbol of all that has passed forever.",

            "The Chestnut TreeCharlotte BinghamThis book I borrowed from my sister and I am so glad I did. I loved this book and found it very compelling and could really feel the life these people had to endure during the war years.The variety of characters and how the dealt with what was happening around them is to me an amazing thing. Each and every character brought something to this story and whether you loved or loathed them you could feel for them and what they had to deal with, loss, death, hardship and learning a new way of living in tough times.If you like historical novels, stories of life during wartime and especially the life of women in these times you will love this book.",
            "The women in England wanted to help with the War effort. They did more than knit socks, they sewed netting for the soldiers protection. Some worked in France for the war.As a result of the war, women changed. They married before their men were sent away. Some had babies when their men came home. Men felt the sacrifice they made for their country.",
            "The chestnut tree of the title plays very little part in the story!Four women in an east coast country town are changed by wartime. Their lives make up the first 120 or so pages before the war gets under way; some lead quite boring and wealthy lives, others hedge rather than marry or act the tomboy around boats.Determined to play an active role, older women set up village circles to make camouflage netting, a slow filthy task. A young woman stows away on a small boat heading to Dunkirk, rescues soldiers and sees tragedy.Another woman works in a factory making barrage balloons and her nights are punctuated by air raids while her friends are killed by almost random bombs. A well-off young women who speaks French and German is recruited as a spy and sent to France.I have read other Bingham books and other wartime stories, and this is not the best of either in my opinion. The effort is good and it does show how women's roles changed but some of the characters failed to hold my affection while there were so many names it could be hard to keep track. The lesson that the previous war to end all wars had been only 22 years previously was certainly well drummed in by the women who had been involved in their day. I felt that the men did not come over well - old and doddery, married Yank philanderer, and so on. Read this but go on to other tales such as 'Lights Out in Liverpool' or 'Blue Birds' for community or war work.",
            "The book was somewhat entertaining, but the use of cliches bothered me. The object/topic of the book is the role of women during WWII, and aims to position them as strong, and valuable as more than housewives. That's why it was annoying that throughout the book, a bottle of cliches was opened. Women are described in terms of their looks/beauty, and e.g. the first spoken sentence is from a woman about her underwear. It almost made me put the book away. The narrative was entertaining at times, but not more than that. The title of the book doesn't really cover its contents, the chestnut tree plays a very marginal role in the book and I wonder if it might have been an editorial decision to name the book thus. ",
            "WW2 drama set in a village where the women all do their bit for the war effort in their own ways. Well written, real people as well as the toffs. There are multiple female front runners as characters they all feel like real people rather then characters. It's unfair to go into the story too much as spoilers would give too much away. Great read and highly recommended. Looking forward to finding part two before I read part three as I like to read them in the correct order.",

            "This is the 8th book I\u2019ve read in the series and I\u2019ve enjoyed them all. I very much appreciate that the authors attempt to stay close to fact as possible using historical, archeological and anthropological findings as we understand them. It is certainly fiction, entertaining, but also provides a glimpse of how Native Peoples lived. As I read this particular I thought it would make a great movie. Suspenseful all the way through.",
            " This takes place in the Lake Erie-Lake Ontario region with the Iroquois about 800 AD.  The prologue present story is about Maureen Cole: a Seneca physical anthropologist who\u2019s husband recently died. A friend of hers asks her come take a look at a new digsite where she meets Dusty Stewart who\u2019s in charge of the digsite. At first they butt heads, but I think they\u2019re perfect for each other. The main story begins with Silver Sparrow, elder of Earth Thunderer Village trying to warn Paint Rock village that Jumping Badger and the Walksalong village is going to attack and steal Rumbler, the False Face Child: a dwarf who has special powers, but they don\u2019t believe him. Rumbler is kidnapped and his village wiped out. From then on the story is basically how Walksalong village decide they made a mistake and try to kill Rumbler to remove a curse, but he is rescued by 12-yr-old Wren. They are chased by two groups: Wren\u2019s uncle, who later is joined by Dust Moon and Sparrow, Rumbler\u2019s grandparents. The second group is Jumping Badger with 20 Walksalong warriors intending to kill them all. Jumping Badger goes mad. He is convinced that Dust has placed a curse on him and if he kills Rumbler he\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s interesting how most of these books involve one or two parties: the bad guys and/or good guys chasing one or two weaker good guys. Blue Raven, Dust Moon and Elk Ivory are the voices of reason in this one and three of favorite characters along with Wren. I like the mention of the different herbal uses: Papaw to ease pain, Yew for fevers, etc. And there are alot of good and happy moments when the bad guys are stopped and the families and villages come together in peace. One thing though: if these are supposed to be people of the masks, then why is the use of masks mentioned so little without a whole lot explanation about how it fits into the story.  But I cringe over the cruelty done to those that other\u2019s \u2018perceive\u2019 to have done something wrong and during the attacks on other villages, though I know that what happened and still does in some areas of the world. We really haven\u2019t advanced much through the centuries. Fave scenes: Lamedeer\u2019s last stand in the cave, Wren and Rambler\u2019s time in the oak tree cave and the storm.",
            "Once again the Gears have brought us back to a time in the beginning, where, once again power is loose. In the ancient forests of modern day Ontario and New York, is Painted Rocks Village, where a young boy lives. This boy is called the False Face Child by those who fear him but goes by the name Rumbler among friends and family.\tIn Walksalong village, Jumping Badger, their war leader has convinced the matrons to attack Rumbler\u2019s village and kidnap him in order to use his power for their own, despite Blue Raven and his niece Little Wren casting their votes against the raid. \tJumping Badger succeeds in the raid but in the process starts to lose his sanity and souls. Rumbler is brought to Walksalong Village but it doesn\u2019t bode well for him. Two of his captors and a matron die mysteriously upon his arrival, casting a dark shadow on his presence. The village then decides that the boy is evil and has brought bad luck to the village and afraid that others will die, they condemn him to death. Blue Raven and Wren take pity on him and offer what little comfort they can. Blue Raven is ordered to sit vigil on the death hill for him. Unexpectedly Wren saves Rumbler and together they set off through the forest. Jumping Badger learns of the boy\u2019s disappearance and mounts a search party to kill the boy and bring Wren back for punishment, despite the voice he hears in his head, haunting him. \tAs the two children flee for their lives, they decide they must turn to Rumbler\u2019s father for support and safety. His father is whispered to be a forest spirit known as The Disowned. Fighting the snow, disagreeing nations and the unknown, the children continue on. Read on as the Gears weave a tale through the winding paths and trails to see if the children survive or if Jumping Badger tracks them down, sealing their fates. ",
            "The Gears, a husband and wife writing team who are both professional archaeologists/anthropologists, have produced an extended series of these \u201cPeople\u201d books, which tell stories of the pre-Columbian peoples of North America, ranging all over the continent as well as different points in a history that spans millennia, from the arrival of the first humans on the continent to just before the age of European colonialism. The books do not need to be read in order. People of the Masks tells the story of Rumbler, a young boy who sees his entire village massacred and is himself taken into slavery because of his supposed supernatural powers. He manages to escape his captors, and the rest of the book details his flight and his pursuit\u2014both by his erstwhile captors and by distant relatives who wish to protect him. Each character, in typical Gear fashion, is painstakingly and believably rendered, making this a complex story that builds to a satisfying climax and resolution. I found myself cheering for Rumbler and his friends, characters I grew to love.I deeply appreciate the Gears\u2019 \u201cPeople\u201d series. While of necessity fiction, each book is based on detailed academic research. The settings and peoples are always realistically drawn, even if the books contain a few mystical elements. The entire series is a needed corrective to the Eurocentric view of history most of us were taught in the West, which virtually ignores North America until the arrival of the colonists. This book is a special treat in this regard, as the epilogue neatly situates the story within the wider context of world events without taking away from the unique history of its main subjects. To a student of history, this ending is a delightful surprise. I highly recommend all the \u201cPeople\u201d books, but this one may be one of my favorites.",
            "This must me my 22nd book I've read from the People series. It's written by a husband and wife team, both are Archaeologists. The People series cover the first North Americans, this one taking place around Ontario and Newfoundland. You don't have to read the books in order, each one tells it's own story.I loved this story, as I have all the others. This one covers more spirits and spirit helpers",
            "An Exceptional Story, Masterfully written I first read this, when I\u2019d rescued a kitten. He was 9 days old.. his fate, was in my hands. I named him Rumbler. He turns 17, on February 3, 2020.This book gave me chills. Made me believe in doing right, even if you stand alone.The fragile hope, of Peace, for a better future, for all.I admit, some scenes, sent chills straight through me.No one, has ever raised goosebumps, besides, Stephen King and the Gears.Over 17 years, I e read this, at least 10 times. Each and every time, i find a new facet, that simply blows my mind.Recommend without any hesitation.",
            "The SeerThis is one of the best books that I have read about North America's Forgotten past. The legion was that a child of power would be born to the Turtle People of the Iroquois nation. He was know as Rumbler, was only a child but had amazing powers. He was captured by the Bear people, to be used him as a spiritual weapon, but was rescued by a young girl named Wren and the story is about their flight from the cruel War Leader of the Bear people who seeks to kill the Spirit child. Their only hope is to find Rumbler's father who will save them. ",
            "Review of 'People of the Masks:: A Novel of North America 's Forgotten Past' by John Lietzke This is the tenth book I have read about native early North Americans. I thought it was a good story so I gave the book five stars. I also thought the story did not have as much action as previous stories I have read about early native Americans.",
            "Interesting story with lovable young characters. This was a quick read over just a couple of days. Again, the book could use a good editor, but I didn't find the errors as glaring in this book as People of the Owl.",
            "RivetingFrom the beginning I hated to put this book down until I finished it!! Looking forward to next in the series",
            "Rumbler's story will long be a hallmark adventure of this series. Bravo!",

            "Review People of the Masks (spoilers) by W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O\u2019Neal Gear The [Indian] leaders influence by their character alone; they follow",
            "The Winter of Crying Rocks, the Moon of Frozen Leaves,unfolds around a tale of superstition, ambition, jealousy, and madness at the center, with evidence, cooperation, love, and reason intertwined. Set in prehistoric eastern North America sometime before the European invasions, several narrators each tell their parallel story as the action moves from the wholesale slaughter of tribal warfare toward former enemies\u2019 peacemaking in the interest of survival and prosperity. Characters are well-developed, each with a history, clear motives, occasional human confusions, as well as their two souls. Summaries of archeo-anthropological information are clear, but could be more fully integrated into the story. A Prologue connects modern days to the time and place of the story, and the personalities found here foreshadow personalities and relationships in the prehistoric novel and further identify the story setting. The fate of the False-Face Child and Little Wren become entangled to the eventual benefit of all.",
            "The Gears wrote another interesting tale of pre-columbian North American tribal love and hate. The sad, hateful misery is driven by the age-old human failings as the selfish, monsterous bad guy looks for more power in life. As in other of the North American native series, the primary evil character feels justified in some kind of self-righteous thinking that it is OK to commit inhuman acts upon fellow humans. The sub plots are interesting so the reader keeps turning the pages. Also typical to this series is the role of magic and powers of perception by the good guys. To me"

        "description": "\"It is our destiny to colonize space, \" announces the author in the first line of this fascinating book. And then he shows us how to go about that seemingly impossible mission in eight (sort of easy) steps. For example, Aquarius, the proposed second step, describes how building floating colonies in tropical waters - using simple engineering and natural aquaculture to reverse the greenhouse effect and end world hunger - will both halt the decline of the planet and prepare us psychologically for the break with Earth. Although the plan sounds far-fetched, Savage explains every detail, from how to build the Ocean Thermal Energy Converters at the heart of this scheme to why cultivating algae will provide an abundant protein source and rid us of the dangerously high carbon monoxide levels that threaten life on the planet. Savage not only transforms an enormously complicated plan into compelling reading, he also makes appealing the prospect of our life in space. The best parts of life on Earth can come with us to outer space, he claims, and he paints a picture of lunar ecospheres, domed and living preserves of our communities on Earth. Our life in space will not be the barren or bleakly technical existence that we have been led to believe. We will re-create all the beauty and diversity that we had on Earth.",

            "One of my favorite books of all time. Just crazy enough to be possible, this guy seriously has a step-by-step for colonizing the galaxy.It challenges you to think BIG and long term, and provides ways to economically solve world hunger, overpopulation, and create a superhuman race of post-earthlings. What is not to like about it?Suspend your judgment, give it a read, and open your mind to the possibilities. I think you'll enjoy it if you read it like you were 14 years old again.",
            " This book is not for the faint-hearted or anyone with a timid imagination. It is an extended manifesto trumpeting the inevitability of humans spreading life throughout the solar system, then the galaxy and then the entire cosmos.Read the rest of the review at SciFiMind.com: https://www.scifimind.com/science-boo...",
            "Read this in my childhood, sometime around 12-15 years old. It was an awesome book at that point. It still inspires me. It has a lot of ideas which are meant as solutions to problems that humanity would bump into while colonizing the galaxy. These ideas are probably more fiction than science, but that's how you start. Anyway, I recommend this book if you are into futurism, science, and space colonization.",
            "When this book was written in the early nineties, indicators of a stressed planet like climate change were still more or less on the horizon. Now that our attention has been drawn more completely to these things, this book seems even more relevant. But more than that, it is a refreshing and optimistic take on how to ensure our civilization doesn't snuff itself out. Rather than limit population growth or play an international zero-sum game, let's colonize space. We can do it, he exhorts us:Let us form of ourselves an army of starship troopers",
            "Sparked a fire in me when I was in college... very interesting ideas!",
            "This was a great read. It kept my interest almost all the way through, despite much of the book being technical details of the various environments that are part of their plan for colonizing space.The book starts with a description of what they propose for their second big step, a floating platform in the ocean which would produce electricity from the temperature differences between warm surface water and deep cold water. It would also grow a lot of algae and seaweed. This colony, being on Earth in the middle of the ocean would also be able to grow fruits and vegetables, culture fish and shellfish, provide pure water, and many other things, some of which would have commercial value, which is good because this whole colonizing space venture will cost a lot of money.From there, the plan is to move to bubble habitats in Earth orbit. For them, they will need to mine some asteroids to provide most of the materials. They will also need to mine the Moon for materials as well. Eventually, domed habitats will be set up on the Moon as well, and after that they will move on to terraforming Mars. Following Mars, they will go to colonizing the Asteroid Belt. Except for exploiting them for resources, they didn\u2019t talk much about trying to colonize the outer Solar System, because the main power source will be the Sun, which isn\u2019t bright enough to be much help at Jupiter and beyond.They also talked about eventually moving out to nearby stars and beyond.These are also serious plans with, as I said, a lot of technical specifications and information about what would be needed and where it might come from, and even how much it would cost (once again, a lot; most of the numbers were in billions).Of course, the farther into space and into the future they get, the more speculative the plans. Some things, like travel to nearby stars, pre-suppose that by the time we reach that point we will have discovered technologies that will allow us to produce antimatter in quantity or some other means of getting ourselves there.At the end, the author talks about the beginning steps that will be needed \u2013 setting up a foundation to plan all these things and to recruit people and raise money for them, and two test colonies on land to serve as proof of concept that many of the ideas needed for the later steps will work.This space-faring civilization will apparently need to be something of a new-age utopian community. I thought when I first added the book to my list that it was a proposal being made to the government, but that is not the case. The vision is for an extra-governmental organization composed of people from all over the world. Obviously, it will need some form of government of its own, but the people involved don\u2019t see that as being like anything currently in use by any of Earth\u2019s nation-states, so that is still under discussion.The second phase, the marine colony Aquarius, sounds really interesting and a lot of fun. I would like to live there myself, but I probably wouldn\u2019t have much to offer them, so it isn\u2019t likely. I\u2019m definitely too old to get involved in any of the space-based plans, even if I did have any skills they would be interested in.The book indicated that they expected construction to begin on Aquarius sometime around 2015, so I wanted to check to see if any progress had been made in that regard. I did find some websites related to the project, so it looks like people are still working on these ideas. It appears that they are working on a 2.0 version of the book, but without reading all the articles on the various websites, I can\u2019t tell if any of the test colonies are underway yet, let alone Aquarius. Below are links to a couple of the sites in case you want to learn more about this interesting project.https://tmp2.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Pagehttps://luf.org/t/index.php",

        "description": "From William Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner to Toni Morrison's Beloved, modern American fiction engaged with slavery has provoked fiery controversy. So will The Longest Memory, the powerful, beautifully crafted, internationally acclaimed fictional debut of prizewinning Guyanese poet Fred D'Aguiar. In language extraordinary for its tautness and resonance, The Longest Memory tells the story of a rebellious, fiercely intelligent young slave, who in 1810 attempts to flee a Virginia plantation - and of his father who inadvertently betrays him. The young slave's love for a white girl who slakes his forbidden thirst for learning and his painful relationship with his father are hauntingly evoked in this novel of astonishing lyrical simplicity. It is a measure of D'Aguiar's achievement and bravery that The Longest Memory is informed not only by the complicities between black slave and white master but also by the tensions among slaves themselves - between stoic survivalists and passionate rebels. Remarkable for its keenness of observation, subtlety, and restraint, The Longest Memory heralds the arrival of a major new voice in the contemporary literature of the African diaspora.",

If it inspires anyone to add this book to their To Read list then both she and I will be much pleased:This week I had the privilege of reading this very short",
            "This novella is on my son's Year 11 reading list next year. And it's a worthy study. It's a simple yet gripping tale of life on a plantation in Virginia around 1810 . It's written in a highly accessible way. It does a great job of highlighting the issues associated with slavery and tells a twisted tale. All the characters are memorable. Chapters are written from varying perspectives of each of the main characters. And there's a special chapter written as editorials from the local paper that reinforces attitudes of the time. A shameful era, and a very well written story. 5 stars.",
            "The storyline was interesting and controversial, but if I'm being honest I wasnt a fan of the writing style. Found the writing unexciting, yet it did delve into the underlying themes and ideas. ",
            "Others have given the essence of the story, a subject that I am familiar with. My comment concerns the author's writing style. Precision and command of language are his clarion calls. A style that is worthy of praise and adulation. ",
            "This book is super ambitious in both subject and structure. D'Aguiar's trademark poesy creates layers of subtlety and intimation that bear multiple reads. Whitechapel the elder slave (more on that later) is sufficiently tortured by his fealty to the institution of slavery, and his subsequent betrayal of his son. The journal entries from Sanders Sr. comprise my favorite chapter; the complex motivations and moral quandaries the old overseer grapples with feel strangely relatable, albeit through the tarnished lens of rape and racism. Lydia and Chapel's relationship is appropriately bittersweet; though I had issues with the layout of the chronology and POVs, knowing that he is already doomed heightens both the drama and the futility.4-Star Issues: mostly minor, though noticeable. Having one name recycled for so many concurrent characters -- Mr. Whitechapel the master, Mr. Whitechapel his son, Whitechapel the old slave, Chapel his son -- would be hard enough to pull off with a one-direction, single-perspective narrator; the chaotic back-and-forth between past, present, and future left me disoriented on occasion.Things that give me pause but are not CANCEL WORTHY:1) Whitechapel marrying a woman younger than his own great-granddaughter. Just a little weird to grapple with in 2020.2) The ham-fisted editorials in The Virginian. The glaring hints that Miss L was in fact Lydia could have been pared back slightly without losing any but the densest of readers.3) The piece at the end where Whitechapel muses about how The master is daylight",
            "Fred D'Aguiar's novel The Longest Memory follows the story of a young slave named Chapel as he learns to play Fortnite. One day he tries to escape the infamous Whitechapel plantation and ultimately gets lashed 200 times like a boss. The novel is quiet enjoyable"

This comes through with titles like this that don't fit comfortably on the shelf with more regularly formatted titles. Tony Millionaire likewise continues to impress with his hallucinatorily disturbing comics that are troubling, hilarious, and beautifully, lavishly drawn. You will simply not find a more wonderfully illustrated comic anywhere, nor one more likely to use disgustingly intimate digestive humor for a laugh. It's a combination - my favorite juxtaposition of high art and low - that never fails to satisfy, no matter how frequently Millionaire goes to the well of inebriated Drinky Crow and his monkey sidekick Uncle Gabby and their sadistic, alcoholic exploits.

They catch up with their bus as a weather plane and go through the eye of the hurricane.Along the way, they go inside a tornado and teach lots of facts about the weather.You're going to learn and enjoy it.",
            "What starts as a field trip to a weather station turns into a much more hands-on experience with deadly storms! Flying through the clouds in the Magic School Bus, Ms. Frizzle's class experiences a hurricane\u2014and even a tornado\u2014firsthand. During their thrilling ride through the sky, Arnold gets lost and the class must follow rescue procedures to save him. In the end, Ms. Frizzle\u2019s class arrives at the weather station, but due to their unconventional field trip, the students can teach the experts a thing or two about hurricanes.The information presented on weather and hurricanes is accurate and written scientifically (real science terms are used). Nevertheless, the facts are clustered in short bursts of information throughout the book, making it more manageable to take in the information. Aside from some of the students falling into \u201ctypes,\u201d there is no apparent stereotyping. The organization of the text\u2014vivid, detailed illustrations that will snag and keep students\u2019 short attention spans constantly fed and eager for more\u2014aid in students\u2019 ability to think analytically about the content.The Magic School Bus TV show was must-see programming, right up there with Wishbone and Bill Nye the Science Guy, when I was a kid. Reading this book brought back memories, but looking at it from a teacher\u2019s point of view, I really see the educational value in the storytelling of Joanne Cole, who found a way to make science topics relatable and comprehensible by wrapping them a modern fantasy narrative.",
            "The Magic School Bus Inside A Hurricane \u2013 Joanna ColeGrade: K-3 Pages: 48Theme: Hurricane, Schools, WeatherGenre: Modern FantasyResponse: While I have read several The Magic School Bus books, I haven't seen/read this one beforehand. Didn't even know it was out there. The title itself intrigued me, especially since we live in Florida where hurricanes are an annual norm now-a-days. As only The Magic School Bus series can",
            "This is another fun book in the Magic School Bus series. After reading what seems like a million of these books, I think I'm in the camp that less dialogue is better. It's hard to keep the narrative and conversations flowing smoothly when I read these stories aloud. I don't think it would be nearly as distracting if you read them silently to yourself. So while we read books aloud together, I prefer the ones with more narrative, less dialogue. In addition there are so many fascinating side blurbs (school reports) of info, that it sidelines the story. But our girls love them, so we'll keep reading them, no matter what the format. ",
            "Ms.Frizzle takes her students into her Magic School Bus and they travel to the inside of a hurricane. The pages of the book are filled with fun facts and trivia at the sides of the pages and there are projects that young readers can easily do at home or at school. I would use this book for a science unit on the weather.",
            "We LOVE Magic School Bus. The BEST science books for kids preschool through elementary school. They grow with the child - you can read as much or as little of the detail as you want because it is not included in the story line - it is inserted in talking windows like comics",
            " This book was very informative. I think it would be useful to use to teach about the weather. Although it would not be a good read aloud book I might still have this book on my shelf in my library if I was teaching 4-5th grade. "

            "\u201cA caravan could travel ten to twelve miles per day in good weather, but that progress was slowed to a crawl when it rained, and when the rains were heavy, it sometimes became necessary to call a complete halt.\u201d I read these words, imagining what such a scene might look like if I were actually there\u2026I can see the courageous wagon master, his skin of his face leathery from the exposure to the elements, he\u2019s tired to the core and soaked to the bone after leading the caravan through a gale force rainstorm. His eyes, however, are blazing with fire, a fire that cannot be extinguished when a man does the work he is born to do. He\u2019s a man who loves the thrill of pitting himself against the unknown. A man who has found a way to marshal the forces of nature in such a way that they have become his allies. He glories in his ability to act quickly and instinctively when dangers threaten the caravan. He\u2019s a man who surveys the great plains with a sense of awe and wonder, knowing that the time will soon come when they will never again look as they do now. I look past the wagon master and now see the sideways glances from the men in the caravan. Their eyes are steely and focused, they\u2019ve learned to be on alert. They\u2019ve learned to keep their families, systems of communication and rifles, close by. Falling prey to the forces opposing their progress is not an option for these men who often travel with the women who are the loves of their lives, the children they cherish and all their worldly possessions, tucked away in the trunks and wagon holds. I then see the wise, courageous and beautiful women of the wagon train. They look a bit haughty, but it\u2019s not out of vain pride, but rather a way of holding one\u2019s head high in dignity when feeling unsafe in the accidental company of the roughest frontier drifters and outlaws with their leering looks and bad intentions. An air of dignity, they know, can intimidate men who might wish to take advantage of them. I could see the way these women comfort their crying children as frightening winds batter the canvas of their home on wheels. I watch as they cover their little ears against the boom of ear-splitting thunder that rolls across the plains. I see these women stand firmly by the men they love. I\u2019m inspired as I see how they strengthen their husbands through love. I\u2019m amazed as I see the occasions when they use cosmetics, purchased in Independence, to enhance their already beautiful faces. I see them riding, on a Sunday, rather demurely, (as many of them are superb horsewomen), parading their subtly applied makeup, snug fitting dresses of linen, (instead of buckskin), with attractive necklines. This reminds their husbands of their lithe, trim figures and the promise of uniting at the end of a hard day. They take the time to remind the men they love that while life is hard on the wagon trail, in their hearts they are still the young, vibrant women who fell in love with them years before. To me, the image I see of these women were the most impressive and amazing of all the character groups in this story. I see the children, the ones least mindful of the rigors of the perilous journey. They will cross the plains while being taught school by their mothers, horseback riding, fishing and shooting by their fathers, and the mysterious ways of the great prairie by the scouts. The fields, streams, boulders, hills, ravines, and later the majestic buttes will be the playground of these children. I imagine that they will hold these memories in their hearts, and years later, after arriving in the promised land of Oregon Territory, will be the ones to write of their memories. Theirs may become some of the greatest of the American frontier storytelling, because all readers, young and old, still hold within themselves the wonder of a child. And what greater story to tell than that of being the first to cross this majestic wilderness? The children, I believe will be the ones best equipped to tell the stories, since their parents and other relatives will be transferring their laborious efforts from making a great journey, to carving out homesteads out of rough hewn and wild land. The children will work, but, thankfully for us, will not be so overly burdened that the stories would be erased from their memories. Finally, I see the great company of the caravan, those who work alongside the wagon master in an effort tot push forward through the wilderness. I see the native guides and wily scouts, the former army men whose marksmanship and survival skills would prove life saving on many occasions on the journey. I also see the blacksmiths, wood gatherers, water carriers, the doctor and veterinarians that took care of the human and animal needs. I see the carpenters who are skilled in axel and wheel repair who play a key role in keeping the wheels of the wagons turning. The quote on the top of this review came at page eight of a 382-page story. It was a grand tale, revealing the events, happy, sad and tragic, that hundreds of courageous souls experienced while travelling into unknown territory as the three great columns of wagons moved along across Missouri and into the expansive Oregon Territory. So richly told was this story, that I couldn\u2019t help as though I too, was one of the pioneers when I read of this important \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for our storied band of travelers:\u201cRoutines were reestablished by the third day out of Fort Madison. The men, women and older children knew what was expected of them and, for the most part, performed their tasks cheerfully. By now they realized they had entered a new phase of life; they had put the last outposts of civilization behind them, and they would see no towns, no villages and no forts hereafter.\u201d As I read, I too felt excitement at the adventures and breathtaking scenery ahead, I also felt the apprehension, knowing that the great wagon train faced many perils and hardships ahead. Man alive, was I hooked!Previous to reading this book, I\u2019d known something of the weather problems and attacks by warring Indian parties that presented serious obstacles and real danger to the pioneers. But I had little knowledge of the resistance that came from armed frontier drifters, and none about the presence of the British and Russians who\u2019d attempted to sabotage the wagon trains on behalf of their respective nations. Each country had staked a claim on the rich and promising lands of Oregon Territory. I wasn\u2019t even done the first chapter and already felt a powerful connection with this story. As I read on, scene by scene, chapter by chapter I was introduced to: A courtly and cunning British spy, a stubborn and gutsy Russian peasant girl who snubs a czar, a hardworking and wise young heiress unaware of her beauty, opportunist frontier scum, a wealthy Austrian noblemen who finds new purpose as a member of the wagon train, a lovesick blacksmith, a girl transformed from spoilt southern belle to a wise and discerning woman of substance, a wagon master who is a true leader, the awe inspiring tale of one of the greatest buffalo stampedes in history, a former slave of the south who becomes a valued contributor and great friend to many, a friendly army colonel who strikes a life saving deal with the members of the wagon train, a concerned and nervous but committed president, an ingenious solution to an infant medical emergency, a war hungry Ponca Tribe, an evil bounty hunter, greedy horse thieves, a Paiute Indian attack that is thwarted and becomes the reason for a lifelong bond between two men, an uneasy partnership between a British and a Russian spy, a spy catcher riding alone across the plains with a rifle a good horse and a crumpled letter of orders from the President of the United States of America in his pocket, a destructive river wave, a colorful and amazingly adept clergyman from the east, an amazing medical discovery and a devious personal representative of the Czar of Russia. This may seem unbelievable, but I\u2019ve only scratched the surface of this amazing and varied story. I\u2019m only to thrilled to realize that it is part of an expansive book series. I cannot wait for the next one! ",
            "Finished the second in the series. Really enjoyed! Can\u2019t wait to start the next volume. Love how the characters continue from one story to the next and new chateau are added to advance the story.",
            "Book one of the Wagon's West series was a delight, one of my favorite books I've read this year. It was predictable with character archetypes more than developed plot or people, but it was executed well enough I really didn't care. Book two was not as fun, but overall not a bad reading experience either. My favorite character from the first book, Sam Brentwood, still got to show up and have some action but the new central character is Whip Holt. Similarly, Claudia is no longer at the forefront, but her younger sister Cathy is.In addition to all the surviving characters from the first book, Dana Fuller Ross (the pen name for the author) adds a few new characters. There's a set of southern aristocrats down on their luck who bring some new attitude problems to the wagon train. There's a new scout named Mack who reminded me of Gary Busey. There's a new Russian spy aiming to take down Toni. There's also an escape slave named Hosea who was kind of problematic (and that's coming from a guy who really doesn't care if my literature hasn't aged well). Hosea is kind of the magical negro you'd find in a Stephen King book. He is deadlier than any man in the wagon train",
            "Very exciting read really enjoyed this book",
            "The narration in this audiobook was fine. The story itself was a disappointing sequel. Many of the elements I winked at in the first book began to grate--treating 19th century Russia like 1970s Cold War Soviet Union (among other things, there was discussion about defecting...? Did immigrants defect in those days?)",
            "so far i am really enjoying the wagons west series.",
            "After reading Independence!",

            "This is book #2 in a series about the first wagon train heading to the Oregon Territory in the 1830's. Very readable, it contains interesting interesting historical references which may or may not be true, may or may not be clich\u00e9, may or may not be offensively sterotypical....While a little predictable and formulaic, the author does a good job balancing the need to retain characters from the previous book, while adding a few new ones. Not exactly shortlisted for Man Booker, but still a fun diversion....",
            "Our favorite Oregon pioneers continue to head west, despite the great challenges facing them - freezing winters, hostile Native Americans, buffalo stampedes, crazy weather, etc.. Anyone remember playing the old Oregon Trail computer game in the 80s? I feel like this is the book form. I've really enjoyed reading about their adventures and will definitely continue on with the series. There are some great new characters in this book, along with favorites from the first in the series. ",
            "Great characters! I am really enjoying rereading this series and enjoying the fictional history lesson. God, they had to work so hard. This one had a lot more killing than the previous one but I guess that is to be expected now that they are in the wilderness. It really creeped me out when ____________ was scalped alive!",
            "Just finished book 2 and it was basically more of the same from the first book... which was expected. Don't know why I have started this series (because I remember it as a child???), but it's a fun, quick, no thinking kind of book that just sets me up to read something else. Kind of like a mind purge. Will read a couple of other books and then back to Wagons West.",
            "May sound somewhat repetitive here but I got hooked on the first book and it was like an addiction.The author shows how the westward movement affected families and individuals while placing them within history itself.",
            "The pioneers continue west. I'm a little behind, this series is kind of old but I love American history and I am amazed at the bravery of folks who went out in a little wagon with a cloth roof and the hardships they endured. The stories are so-so but I like the history.",
            "An excellent adventure. Every time I travel west across the vast plains of Kansas and Eastern Colorado towards the Rockies and beyond, I imagine what life would be like as an American pioneer. This series gives great insight to those that bravely explored before us.",
            "In spite of myself I am caught up enough in this story to continue reading the series. Love the historical parts and the how people lived parts, but, the romance parts, not so much. Although I realized love and marriage happened along the way, it was just too predictable. ",
            "Although this Series suffers a bit from it's Age, I still found it an enjoyable Read, as was the first book, Independence! A vivid portrayal of the experience of the First Pioneers to settle the West, with interesting characters & entwined plots.",
            "Ross, Dana Fuller PB",
            "The books in this series give ore than history..they explain the details of people's lives in this era...fascinating",
            "Fun western. Second in the series.",
            "Interesting book. I enjoyed the details of the daily life that the pioneers faced. At times I wished for a deeper look into the thoughts of the characters. ",

            "Love this line in the book when the main character Honora meets her prospective husband and is commenting on his less than perfect appearance....Honora laid these flaws aside as one might overlook a small stain on a beautifully embroidered tablecloth one wanted to buy",
            "What I liked: The setting - Shreve does a great job evoking the atmosphere of the New England coast/mill town in the Depression era. I liked learning about the mill strikes & plight of the workers & those who led the strikes. I would have liked a lot more detail about that. I liked the interesting rhythm that Shreve has created with the story - a rhythm that echoes the sea itself - the story sort of surges forward & then backs off, surges & backs off. This was a little weird at first but then I got into it. I liked some of the characters but not all. My main difficulty with the book is that I feel it's a little superficial. I wanted to go deeper into Honora, & McDermott, & some of the others. Other characters like Sexton didn't interest me at all, so I couldn't figure out why Honora married him in the first place. If it had a little more depth I would give it four stars but I don't think this one is going to stick with me. ",

And it also gives insight into a tragic part of our country\u2019s history\u2014the Great Depression of the 1920\u2019s. I liked that she used sea glass as a metaphor for the human spirit. No matter how much it is battered by the rough sea, it does not break; it becomes more beautiful. I loved the friendship between Honora and Vivian, women from two different worlds who are drawn together. I didn\u2019t want the story to end. And, it got me interested in collecting seaglass, which I\u2019m now obsessed with.",
            "No, no, no... Though there were touching moments in this book that I enjoyed, I felt like the plot was SO boring for such an important issue. I really had a hard time finishing this book (which is extremely rare,) until it started picking up a little bit at the end. I always love the way Anita Shreve writes about character interaction. Using her words, I can always picture exactly the way a person is moving, smiling, speaking, and how they are feeling. Maybe that's why I'm so addicted to her despite the fact that half of her books are disappointing.Oh well. ",
            "Set in the early depression era somewhere on the East Coast, the novel follows Honora and Sexton Beecher from the beginning of their marriage. They moved into a large deserted old house on the beach and threw themselves into making it habitable with mostly sweat equity and little money. Sexton is away every week because of his job as travelling salesman and Honora lives a quiet but very structured life. She walks frequently on the lonely beach and collects colorful bits of sea glass. When the owner decides to sell the home, Sexton manages to scrape together enough for the down payment and takes a mortgage at the local bank. Unfortunately, it's at the worst possible time as banks are starting to collapse and many are losing their jobs. The story follows the arc of their relationship from good times to bad and explores the discoveries they make about each other as a result of their travails. Part of the subtext of the story is revealed through homey letters from Honora's mother. Sexton becomes involved with a group of men fomenting a strike at the local textile mills. Their home becomes the headquarters of the organizers, bringing them into the center of a dangerous and controversial movement.The historical context of the novel was interesting, but what was most compelling was Anita Shreve's ability to create a fully imagined, complex, sympathetic character - Honora Sexton. I could imagine myself living in her time and faced with the same challenges. It's not always possible to associate yourself so completely with a fictional character",
            "This was given to me by a work colleague and as I give any book from any genre a go, I smiled and said thank you.Having read a few by AS, I had a feeling that I wouldn't be jumping up and down about this. I was right... not for me. Uninspiring writing that left me feeling flat. I could not picture the scene at all.",
            "This is the 2nd Shreve book I finished in the last couple of weeks. I really enjoyed reading it, though not quite as much as Light on Snow. The structure of the book -- alternating between the viewpoints of the different characters -- made it take a little while to really get into it and feel invested in the characters, but once they started intersecting, I couldn't put it down. And the structure provided some great symbolism -- little threads weaving in and out of others' lives, sometimes only briefly, and sometimes with monumental consequences.One final note: I also recently read The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, and apparently like many others, absolutely hated the ending -- so much so that it ruined the whole book for me. Wroblenski supposedly set out to write a tragedy, and I guess he did, although a completely pointless one that made we want to chunk the book in the trash. Sea Glass provides a great contrast, and I would argue, is the way to write a tragedy without angering your readers. There is, literally, a pointless massacre at the end of Sea Glass. The two people you want to live happily ever after don't. The bad guy gets away. But unlike in Edgar Sawtelle"

It is the sacred text with the most commentary about it from several religions. It is also the most misunderstood writing, despite all the study it has received. Good Torah, meaning teaching, has it's own message for each reader. The key to receiving the message it has is to be completely open to it, without reaction, without preconceived ideas about it, and without judgement. What you are meant to receive and learn from it, Torah will reveal to you. It will challenge you to really look at you and how you view the world and it will draw you to finding the sacredness in all aspects of life, to seeking justice, and to realizing our equal importance as humans in the spiraling progress of life.

            "AC Crispin does herself no favours in my estimation in Han Solo: Rebel Dawn. Her books were just fine up until Interlude One, where she suddenly offers up a shitty encapsulation of Brian Daley's Han Solo at Star's End.I am not sure why she couldn't simply have finished her story before the Star's End adventure happened (but I haven't finished her book either. I paused my reading so that I could read Daley's book, so I will return to her book tonight), but since I had the Daley books handy, she nudged me into reading the source of the interlude, and it would have been better for Crispin's Han Solo if I hadn't been diverted. See my Han Solo love runs deep. It burst out fully formed in 1977 when I watched him blow away Greedo, then nonchalnatly toss a credit to the barkeep, saying, Sorry about the mess. My Han Solo was a genuine criminal. A drug running",
            "When a book is under 200 pages, there really isn't a whole lot to say without giving away most of the plot fairly quickly. Suffice it to say that Han Solo at Stars' End, while not about to win any prizes or anything, was a really fun book to read. Brian Daley throws his reader directly into the action and except for a brief pause now and then it's a frenetic pace from one harrowing situation to the next with our hero Han Solo and his trusty companion Chewbacca the Wookie. This is a great side-story from the old days of the Star Wars galaxy before the gaps were all filled in by episodes I-III, heck before the Empire Struck Back or there was a Return of a Jedi, the Clone Wars were just an event from the past that were referred to from time to time, but not really understood by the fan/reader/viewer. That's part of what made this story so fun. It took me back to a time when Star Wars was just Star Wars, not Episode IV: A New Hope. Man, I loved that stuff back in the day and this story took me back to the adventure and romance of that far, far away Star Wars galaxy a long time ago. If you grew up with the Star Wars franchise and loved it as I did, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't have any great literary epiphany, but you'll have a rollicking good time with characters and a world that you know and love.",
            "Ahh, the good old days of when Star Wars didn't suck and Han could shoot first. That is pretty much as good of summation about this book as any, honestly. It felt right... like you imagined Han Solo was really like before all of the movies. Good clean fun, with the banter being fairly close to the on-screen material. Now if you are looking for Tolkien, this book is not it. Nor is this Herbert or Asimov. But Mr. Daley didn't screw this book series up by laying a steaming pile of Disney either. Thank God for that. 4 Stars",
            "Still a fun read after all of these years but different than the Post-Expanded Universe books because it's mostly disconnected from the rest of the Star Wars Universe. Written at a time when Lucas was experimenting with his brand but didn't want anything written that would force his hand on the movies, etc., it takes Solo and Chewbacca off to a distant place far removed from The Empire, Jabba the Hutt and more. While it does examine their pre-Luke Skywalker life, it makes no references to anything familiar other than the two characters and their beloved ship, making it markedly different than most other Star Wars tie-ins. Still, the character do feel like those we grew to love on screen and they do have fun banter and action adventures. Daley wisely throws in some alien races and droids without them seeming too close to the beloved ones from the films either. And the books are short and well-paced. Altogether good reads that fit in nicely beside A.C. Crispin's deeper examination of Solo's early years and meeting Chewbacca.",
            "It really rates 3.5 stars but Goodreads doesn\u2019t believe in half stars apparently. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s pulp, it\u2019s briskly written. Brian Daley was a gem, and he had a great grasp of why the audience loved Han Solo.",
            "Han Solo y Chewbacca sufren algunas dificultades t\u00e9cnicas con el Halc\u00f3n Milenario, este problema les conduce a otro peor y acaban metidos en un fregado con la Autoridad del Sector Corporativo.Leer novelas tempranas de Star Wars siempre me produce una sensaci\u00f3n peculiar. Para empezar, son poco exigentes con el fan casual, el que no va a los estrenos disfrazado de mamarracho ni llama Grogu a su hijo. Con esto quiero decir que, para entenderlas y sacarles el m\u00e1ximo partido, no hace falta que consumas previamente tropecientos productos de la franquicia, ya sean otras novelas, c\u00f3mics, videojuegos, series de televisi\u00f3n o el texto impreso en las cajas de los mu\u00f1ecos. Las \u00fanicas referencias que necesitas son las propias pel\u00edculas (en este caso, la primera, porque no hab\u00eda m\u00e1s cuando se escribi\u00f3 y public\u00f3), y es liberador poder pasar de p\u00e1gina habi\u00e9ndolo entendido todo y sin tener que preocuparte por si te habr\u00e1s perdido algo importante.Adem\u00e1s, los autores de estas primeras novelas de la saga pod\u00edan enriquecer el universo creado por George Lucas sin estar tan encorsetados. Ten\u00edan menos material con el que jugar y que despertase su imaginaci\u00f3n, pero las \u00fanicas reglas eran las que ten\u00eda en ese momento el propio Lucas en la cabeza, no necesitaban una interminable enciclopedia de conocimientos ni un equipo de revisores detr\u00e1s para evitar cagarla.Todo eso est\u00e1 bien. La contrapartida de esta novela, anterior incluso a El Imperio contraataca, es que apenas se parece al Star Wars que conocemos. Te convences a ti mismo de que es un libro de Star Wars porque el protagonista se llama Han Solo y porque tambi\u00e9n salen Chewbacca y el Halc\u00f3n Milenario; pero, por lo dem\u00e1s, podr\u00eda ser una novela de fantas\u00eda espacial cualquiera. La historia se sit\u00faa cronol\u00f3gicamente dos a\u00f1os antes de la batalla de Yavin (el antes de Cristo del universo Star Wars)",
            "Going solely off the cheesy cover art, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was just another lame tie-in novel from the 1970's, probably written to sucker pre-adolescents out of their allowance money. The reality, though, is that HAN SOLO AT STAR'S END is actually a legit sci-fi novel with a fun plot, great concepts, clever writing, and terrific world-building. Even the character development is decent, and Brian Daley is especially good at making all Han Solo's dialog seem completely Harrison Ford-esque. No, the story details don't really gel with actual STAR WARS canon, but who cares about canon now that it's being determined by a bunch of Disney execs? I'm 98% certain that Disney would've been better off to simply adapt this novel into next year's Han Solo solo movie rather than starting over from scratch. I seriously doubt director Ron Howard will be able to give us anywhere near the bang for our buck that HAN SOLO AT STARS' END provides.",
            "After having just read Splinter of the Mind's Eye, this was a breath of fresh air. Loads of fun, action packed and Han Solo even admits he's the kind of guy who likes to SHOOT FIRST and ask questions later. Unfortunately, it bogged down a bit at the end and the climax felt a little too ridiculous, but still fun and worthy of any fan's time for a quick adventure. I'm sure this will be better than the upcoming Solo movie.2.5 stars"

BUT, now that I've read him, I'm once-again reminded that 'pulp' writers are usually very much to my liking regardless of whether they're 'cheesy' or not. I think of my recently deceased pal Blaster Al Ackerman. He was extremely impressed & influenced by pulp writers - mostly",
            "Laumer has always struck me as being Ron Goulart\u00a0without the wit . . .  Roger Tyson's car breaks down in the midst of a thunderstorm. He tries to flag down a cute lady motorcyclist but she swerves to miss him, plunges off the road, and hits a tree. Before she dies she gives him instructions as to what he should do, most notably that he should take the gadget she's just pulled out of her ear and stick it in his own -- which he does, to discover that, even though she is dead, her thoughts aren't and she can communicate with him. Back on the road, he tries to flag down another motorist, noticing just too late that this one looks like a giant tentacled rutabaga with a pizza for its single eye. This traveller, too, swerves; it dies in the resulting smash. Roger climbs aboard the dead woman's bike and heads for town. There, with the help of the instructions from his earpiece, he discovers in the restroom of the bus station an Aperture -- a dazzling line of light. To escape arrest under suspicion of intent to commit graffiti in the restroom (I told you this lacked Goulart's wit), he dives through the Aperture and into another world.  Thanks to Apertures, he proceeds to pass through an array of other worlds, often pursued by the rutabaga (whom he later discovers is an alien being of a species called the Rhox) -- which continues the pursuit no matter how often he kills it. Indeed, as he adds friendly (and not so friendly) companions, he discovers that, in whichever world they might be, they seem to be confined to a single, endlessly looping day: with each new dawn the food that they ate yesterday is restored, anyone who died yesterday is restored to life, and so forth. It's up to Roger to try to establish the rules of this time trap and, of course, to break them. His adventuring eventually leads him to the far-future epoch where the lady motorcyclist, Q'nell, came from; he recognizes her, although for her it's the first time she's met him. She and her colleagues are in effect museum curators; all the different realities through which Roger has chased are, so Q'nell and co believe, museum exhibits, and they're intent on putting an end to the disruption to the museum that he and his chums have been causing. To this end, they propose to send Q'nell back in time . . . thereby, as Roger points out, futilely restarting the loop. So, this time, he goes back with her . . .  Obviously, this being a wacky novel, that doesn't go to plan either. At last Roger finds himself in the presence of a robot, UKR, who really knows what's going on: there are 10,404,941,602 capsule realities, of which Roger has experienced but a tiny fraction, and they're in effect the 10,404,941,602 microscope slides of an experimental series that UKR is maintaining as part of a Filing System he -- it? -- runs for the mysterious extratemporal Builders, or Builder. By story's end, all is stabilized and of course Roger gets the girl. No one gets a cigar for guessing who the Builder turns out to be.  As will be evident, there are some jolly good skiffy ideas mixed in here among the lavatory humour,\u00a0some truly appalling sexism and a plethora of jokes that aren't so much overburdened as beaten repeatedly into the ground with the flat of a shovel. Here's the moment when Roger gets a glimmer of understanding as to what the whole string of realities, and his place therein, might represent:  He paused as a concept formed in his mind: three-dimensional reality, gathered up at the corners, pulled up to form a closed space, as a washwoman folds up the edges of a sheet to form a bag . . . (p29)  And here's UKR's explanation of the way that four-dimensional creatures function:  [T:]here's only one Rhox in the entire cosmos; like most entities above fourth level, he is unique. When the process you know as evolution progresses beyond a certain point, the species-fragmentation characteristic of [the:] third order merges to form a higher, compound life-form. Such a being can insert a large number of third-order aspects into contiguous space. (p137)  While these and a few other ideas are very pretty, I'm not sure they're enough to make me hunt down this book's sequel, Back to the Time Trap (1992).",

Reminiscent of the beloved books of British veterinarian and writer James Herriot, Perrin's book is by turns heartbreaking and hysterical. In 22 stories, he relays his encounters with an eclectic group of two-legged clients and a roster of four-legged patients that range in size from a newborn kitten to a 1,500-pound pregnant heifer. Perrin's honest account of veterinary life includes his mistakes, successes, and frequent searches for answers to problems that most of us will thankfully never have to consider (for example, how does one discourage the advances of an amorous billy goat').

            "Let me begin by saying I have been totally spoiled by James Herriot. He wrote with sincerity and humor while sharing enough details to give insight and a real feel for what the rural vet experience was like in England during and after WWII. You really feel like you've met Tricky Woo and his mistress. It's like you have been in the barn, present at the birth of a calf. So, it is safe to say I have a love of veterinarian memoirs, and this one did not let me down. There are the usual quirky folks and strange animal doings. But, Perrin's writing is a bit more graphic and medical. I had to gloss some parts quickly or put down my sandwich. But, these are animals and families you will enjoy meeting through Perrin's amusing memories of his practice.",
            "Generally I'm not surprised that I enjoyed this book but I think I am surprised by how much I enjoyed it! Dr. Perrin adds great human touch to his veterinary tales (starting in 1971 - Creston B.C.) and I think it's because he seems to display such warmth and humility in dealing both with people and with animals. He had me laughing and choking up; quite often within the same story. My only complaint .. for those of us with weak stomachs ... there was probably too much detail shared (and too often) on the process of cows giving birth. I'll forgive though --- because it makes me glad people like him (and not me) become vets. I'm just better off sticking to reading about the aftermath. ",

        "description": "In Father Michael McGivney (1852-1890), born and raised in a Connecticut factory town, the modern era's ideal of the priesthood hit its zenith. The son of Irish immigrants, he was a man to whom \"family values\" represented more than mere rhetoric. And he left a legacy of hope still celebrated around the world.In 1882, Father McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, an organization that has helped to save countless families from the indignity of destitution. From its uncertain beginnings, when Father McGivney was the only person willing to work toward its success, it has grown to an international membership of 1.7 million men.At heart, though, Father McGivney was never anything more than an American parish priest, and nothing less than that, either -- beloved by children, trusted by young adults, and regarded as a \"positive saint\" by the elderly in his New Haven parish.Moving and inspirational, Parish Priest re-creates the life of Father McGivney, a fiercely dynamic and yet tenderhearted man, and chronicles the process of canonization that may well make Father McGivney the first American-born parish priest to be declared a saint by the Vatican.",

            "In the latter part of the 1800s, an anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant attitude prevailed in America. In the midst of this setting in Connecticut was a young, caring Catholic priest. His concern for widows and orphans led him to form a fraternal organization of Catholic men to aid widows and orphans. This is the story of Father McGivney's short life and the beginning of the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic organization today. Father McGivney is undergoing the path to be declared a saint. In this day and age of wayward religious, it is good to read about a priest or other religious from any faith who tried to walk in Christ's footsteps.",
            "This book does a great job of laying out the life of a parish priest in America. It also gives a lot of great information about the founding of the Knights of Columbus which is a Catholic fraternal order focused on charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism that supports church and family.Highly recommended.",
            "\u201cHis life, however, was not described by great occasions or grand gestures. His was the humility of moments, and the power beheld in the lightest of touches\u201d (202). These lines at the end of this great book describe the life of Father Michael McGivney but may make some wonder why there is a biography of him. McGivney is the founder of the Knights of Columbus, a group for men in the Catholic Church which today numbers nearly 2 million men. But the authors don\u2019t focus so much on that aspect as they use McGivney as an example of American Catholicism in the 19th century. More importantly, they give us insight in the role of the parish priest.They bring alive the Connecticut atmosphere and connect it with the overall status of priests at the time to give a sense of what life would be like for these servants of God. While it makes no claims to be an overview of all American Catholicism during that time period, the book shows what it was like in the established East Coast and, surprisingly, recognizes the demands that parish priests face today.McGivney becomes a priest after some of the more violent actions toward Catholics have subsided in the U.S., but prejudice against him because of his faith is something he shares with all his parishioners. In addition, we see how the Irish Catholics supplement the shortage of priests by importing priests from their homeland. McGivney is American born and goes through an educational process similar to today when a diocese directs their future priests to certain seminaries. It is this mix of Irish priests trying to connect with a more diverse parish that pushes McGivney from a quiet priest to one determined to meet people where they live. Before this priests were expected to spend most of their time on church grounds, but McGivney and others realize they need to reach out to people.Right out of seminary he is put into a church with an ailing head priest and a mountain of debt, which he works at reducing but will never fully succeed at doing. The ailing priest is not an old priest, just another worn-out priest. The authors note that over a 12-year span the Hartford diocese had 83 priests. During the same time, 70 priests died, creating an 85% turnover rate. Why? While priests were exposed to more disease than most, they were also greatly overworked and had little, if any, time off. The authors note that most priests knew they would not live to be 50 years old, but to be fair we have to realize the average lifespan at that time was around 42 years. McGivney had just turned 38 when he died. Yet in the midst of all that, McGivney started yet another project with the Knights of Columbus.Men\u2019s groups were very popular during this time and many of them contributed funds in an early version of life insurance for widows and children. McGivney saw that many Catholic men were becoming more involved in these groups than the church, so he created the Knights as a way to offer a group that followed Catholic teaching yet created the same benefits for its members. In this, he was more successful than he would ever realize. Here I would like the authors to spend more time on this history because what is presented is so negative it is a surprise the Knights survived. Clearly, we are missing something.There is now an official process underway for McGivney to be considered for sainthood. Since the book was published in 2006, Pope Benedict XVI declared McGivney \u201cVenerable\u201d in 2008. Catholics may now seek his intercession in prayers and if a miracle is attributed to him, he moves on to be called \u201cBlessed.\u201d This can be a long process, but if it occurs he would be the first American-born parish priest to be canonized.Whether he is canonized or not (and the book takes no stand on that) McGivney is a priest worth reading about and this book is an excellent look into his life and American Catholicism in the late 19th century. If you are interested, you can visit the Knights of Columbus site to learn more about the group McGivney founded.",
            "It's remarkable that today we seem to think the only way someone can be discriminated against is by the color of their skin. As a Franco-American raised Catholic, I've long been interested in its other forms. Part of the history behind this diverging avenue can be found among the many and well-publicized Irish immigrants who came to America in the 1800s, who were also by and large Catholics. This book explores perhaps the most famous continuing legacy of those times (other than the presidency of JFK), the Knights of Columbus, and the man who founded them, Father Michael McGivney.It's not the subject matter I'm rating low, by any means. It's the fact that Douglas Brinkley and Julie Fenster seem to have taken for granted that their subject matter would probably not attract an audience far beyond Catholics or Knights. Their depth of insight into the times is acceptable, but in trying to tell McGivney's story with an apparent scant personal record (despite referencing a 700 page document of his activities), they generalize just about every topic they touch. The impression is that they stretch an article into a book.Personally, I find this kind of history lacking. If you have to spend time filling in blanks with background material from other sources, leave your conjecture to its proper place, limited to introduction and epilogue. And if you find conclusions that can easily be drawn from the material, which can be found throughout this book but never hazarded, then make them.It's a good book, all considered, for shedding light on a particular aspect of Catholic history, and perhaps later someone will come along and truly do the subject justice. This was the first McGivney biography. It proves there's fruitful material. It also proves that timidity is probably not something that ought to be associated with this man.",
            " This was a well written account of the life of Father Michael McGivney using limited documentation. The bio information was sparse and the authors filled in with the history of the Catholic Church in Connecticut and New England in general. The founding of the Knights of Columbus was covered well as it is essential to the ongoing legacy of the life of Father McGivney. If you have an expectation of a full biography you will be disappointed. If you temper your expectations to a more general coverage of Father McGivney and Catholicism in Connecticut, you will be pleased. A bit more on the expansion of the Knights of Columbus and Father McGivney's shadow role would have been welcome, although with limited documentation to validate it, it would have been conjecture.",
            "This is a biography of a man I had never heard of before, Father Michael McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. As the son of a Lutheran minister, I find myself sympathetic to finding out about the lives of people who choose the ministry as an occupation. Using mainly newspaper articles, the authors recreate the life of this parish priest from Connecticut until his death in 1890 at the age of 38. I found their discussion on Catholicism's place in the America of the late 1800s to be very interesting, as well the retelling of Father McGivney's life story. His involvement in founding the Knights of Columbus meant very little to me, but the book gives a good sense of this good and kind man and the times in which he lived. ",
            "Really good book. Author used some vocabulary that was hard to understand and I had to look up to know what he was saying - it could have been said in simpler words to make reading more accessible to everyone. I have a master's degree and read hundreds of books each year and still had to find out what some words meant. I was interested in the story because I am Catholic and I work at an organization that was started by the Knights of Columbus so I wanted to know more about their founder, Fr. McGivney",
            "Father Michael McGivney was a revolutionary priest. Douglas Brinkley wrote an excellent biography and it was a pleasure to read. The book was quick read, and I enjoyed every section. I was astounded by the work of the Irish Catholics and their contribution to American Catholicism in the 1850s. If you are Irish and Catholic, I think you would be surprised of how much of a legacy your history has in America. Overall, I rank the book 4 out of 5 and it should take a great reader about 4 days to ready it. "

            "Peter Levenda continues his trilogy detailing deep politics and occult/intelligence community connections in some of the 20th Century's most infamous incidents. In this volume Levenda goes a little off track, and his own personal politics rear their head despite his best efforts to remain neutral. It may very well be true that most occult and intelligence aspects are attached more firmly to Republicans and individuals on the right in American politics, and Levenda is simply following that individual thread. His bias becomes obvious by his omission of important events that happen on a Democratic president's watch. The final chapter is essentially an overtly stilted attempt to prove the validity of Hillary Clinton's claim in the 1990s that she and Bill were victims of a vast right wing conspiracy. It's nauseatingly fawning and sympathetic towards the two of them",
            "Levenda has somehow managed to become simultaneously one of the most respected and least trusted writers in so-called conspiracy subjects. Despite its flaws",

However, I do believe that we should keep ourselves informed about occult activities that have infiltrated and corrupted our political process.This is the second volume in a three-volume work in which Peter Levenda continues his investigation of occult involvement in politics begun in Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement With the Occult.As with Levenda's other books, this one is well researched, and if I were rating the book on research alone, I would give it five stars. Unfortunately, Levenda is somewhat long-winded, and these books, like his others, could be better organized. Indeed, this three-volume set could be shortened into a powerful and more effective single volume.If you have ever suspected that there is more to American politics than meets the eye, this book (and volumes 1 and 3) will certainly make you think about what is really happening behind the scenes.",

Believe what you want, but it's weird world and our government is and has been involved in some weird stuff. There's a lot of background propinquity between stories that individually make the news. All this crazy shit comes from somewhere and some of it is interrelated, but you don't hear much about that in scoop-driven news coverage. ",
            "Lots of interesting information, but he never quite ties it all together in any convincing way. He also really shits the bed in the final chapter, with a lot of misguided, sloppily argued, poorly grounded apologism for the Clintons. So much slop there that it's a waste of time trying to itemize all of the missteps. ",
            "It's as good as the first, but it gets more complex, gives more information, more references, more characters, more plots, more information...And it's too much sometimes.I truly admire Levenda for his work but... Holy sh*t it can be too much to swallow in one go."

He was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early to write for magazines and the stage.

Het beste voorbeeld is dat van de ijsberen, die dagenlang de poolreizigers in hun ijshuis omsingelen, en als ze niet buitenkomen, beginnen de vijf ijsberen ijs vast te stampen, er blokken van te maken en die rondom de ijshut te stapelen, om zo de inwoners te laten stikken.

            "All people desire the Good. So says Aristotle.Yes, EVERYTHING works for the Good. What Good, though? Well, he says, their OWN version of Good! And THAT\u2019s why all politicians are so inherently different - AND why some get on our nerves. And WE\u2019VE all got different preconceptions - ourselves!You see, he learned from his teacher, Plato, that the Good is naturally in our human subconscious - and is also an Ideal - ABOVE us!Want a friendly tip?When you\u2019re finished browsing through the latest headlines screaming blue murder over political dirty double dealings, browse through THIS!It\u2019ll open the windows of your mind and let in some fresh air...Meet the vigorous, affable philosopher Aristotle, as he jostles through the Polis Agora, bumping into old friends, cheerfully waving to others in the distance, and stopping to join his buddies in friendly talk about the government\u2019s latest projects.Some of his interlocutors may gripe that it\u2019s just more of the same old tired routine.Not Aristotle!His well-thought out rebuttal to these naysayers would have been a detailed and densely populated paysage moralis\u00e9 of plain, optimistic good sense.For Aristotle, bless his soul, always ac-cen-tu-at-ed the Positive!His jauntiness and well-mannered public ease Radiated Good Health.And bonhomie too... He was a good man.He knew what goodness was: because he avoided evil.And he also had a nifty way to get us out of any bad moods - with his twin teaching of ens and potens. For if a person isn\u2019t acting all too nicely now, he always has the potentiality to be Good inside himself!And everything changes.Does that remind you a bit of The Power of Positive Thinking?Maybe, but WHERE did this great thinker get his eternal Optimism and Presence of Mind? You know, there are TWO answers to that question: one simple, the other complex.The simple answer is that Aristotle, through constantly meditating on the Good, gradually let it saturate his Entire Awareness.The difficult answer is the old Zen Koan, to wit, \u201cWHO is this little man who goes in and comes out of your mouth several times a day?\u201d Well the answer, of course is... your Self - in its private, and its public personas.When we open our mouths, we escape into an empty public space. We\u2019re suddenly in the Political Centre Stage. We risk pride, anger, embarrassment - and possible Collapse of this little travelling man, our Self.Aristotle, you see, by fully imbuing himself with the Goodness of Pure Being, had made himself from two separate selves, into One Whole - and the Original - Self!Well, that was Aristotle for you - 2,500 years BEFORE Norman Vincent Peale was even born!And maybe you can\u2019t make a big social splash that way. But your enemies will be few and far between if you practice it!And so we can easily imagine Aristotle put a LOT of otherwise wary people at their ease. But that\u2019s not the picture we\u2019ve been given of him...No - for we\u2019re accustomed to think of him as totally above and beyond us - a gloomy, tendentious old soul who must always remain the privileged property of persnickety professors.But he\u2019s not. He will always be a fresh summer breeze refreshing our callous cynicism!And he will sweep all our dreary snap political judgments right off the table.And begin right back at the beginning with a Level Playing Field.So, there ARE indeed wise, positive-minded thinkers who point us to the straight and narrow road to truth.Like Aristotle, who believed that Good Politicians really DO exist.",
            "Despite the warnings and protests that I have received from goodreads friends about reading Aristotle's politics into our current political situations and vice versa, I will attempt to do just that in this review - unapologetically. Obviously, I am well aware that Aristotle lived over 2300 years ago; indeed, I would have to be pretty ignorant to be reading him to this degree and not be aware of that fact (I have now completed almost his whole corpus - minus his zoological writings and his Eudemian Ethics). Also, I am fully aware that societal conditions do change, in both subtle and not so subtle ways. I am always amazed though at a particular tendency of some people to consider anything more than a few decades old to be pass\u00e9 and obsolete. I am sure my goodreads friends are not guilty of this degree of naivety. I remember debating someone on the American founding fathers and whether their ideas were still relevant to our current political situations...! Yes, someone was actually taking the position that the founding father's views on the republic they formed were not relevant today. This is obviously an extreme example of how clueless people can be when it comes to ideas and their relationship to progress. My feeling is that if you are arguing that past thinkers held demonstrably different ideas when they spoke about freedom, equality, rights, laws, ethics - etc etc et al \u2013 then you are simply playing a game of equivocation and using time as an accomplice in your charade. I know my goodreads friends are not this extreme (at least I hope). Why read philosophy if one considers its ideas to have a shelf life? There are certainly more practical uses of one's time if this were the case. I am cognizant of the warnings my friends provided and those warnings are not without merit, but with the preceding introduction, hopefully, I have provided a defense for the following review. The review itself should also make clear where Aristotle's ideas are still relevant. I am certainly willing to debate the merits of Benjamin Jowett's translation because I am taking it as correct. The burden of proof though is on the person who questions Jowett's translation; it is on them to present the Greek words and the English terms that they consider more correct than his rendering. I won't take seriously textual criticisms that don't offer evidence and source material for substantiation. Saying someone claimed something about Aristotle that can't be substantiated is not an argument as far as I am concerned. If one provides sources and evidence, I will certainly take it seriously.I want to first off address one issue that was brought forth in a comment. Aristotle and Plato did not have any experience of the exact kind of democracy we know of today. Aristotle believed in equality, but it was an equality of similars, i.e. only men of a certain status were accepted as citizens. Sharing in that similar condition qualified them as equals. It wasn't equality based on humanity alone. Slaves, women, and children were not included in citizenship in the Greek city-states; and Aristotle did indeed follow this precedent. That is certainly one way that democracy has changed. Of course, these changes were made relatively recently. Basing equality on being human alone is an element that was added to democratic ideals subsequently (one should probably note that Christian ethics was largely the influence behind this innovation). There were, however, reasons for including status (e.g. owning wealth/property, military service, etc) into questions of citizenship in Aristotle's day. That is something I am going to get into below when I talk about the dangers of democracy that have always existed. That is not to say that I support the ancient Greek perspective on this question. Clearly, it doesn't matter what the political system is when one falls into the category of the disenfranchised listed above; all systems would be tyrannical in that case. Any system that does not take into account inherent human value into questions of equality is a system that is not at all just - except in an equivocal sense. One should note that there is absolutely no question that all political systems in the West (including here in America) are rooted in a Greco-Roman precedent. This is as undeniable as that our ethics and morals (not to mention religious ideals) are rooted in a Judeo-Christian precedent. I am certainly of the opinion that those who first wrote on these topics still have something to teach us; and those ideas are often still applicable. I read the Bible because I believe it's morals and ethics are entirely relevant for us. As we move further away from the preceding, the worse society will be. In like manner, the earliest writers on the political systems that inspired ours are still entirely relevant. People often do not have much of a grasp of what occurred in the Greek city-states. The Greeks experimented with different forms of government. These weren't just topics that they debated in writing, they were lived out! I cannot stress this enough. The political systems that are referred to in Plato and Aristotle (removing the speculative elements they added) were tested. Humanity hasn't changed that much in 2300 years. For an example (as I mentioned in my review to Cicero's On Moral Duties), Socialism/Communism is not a new idea. Aristotle was aware that one potential abuse of democracy was when some demagogue promised the disenfranchised that he would take the money and/or property from the wealthy and give it to them if they supported him (I will provide quotes below). Obviously, even if one didn't have property, it didn't necessarily mean that in an ancient democracy that one had no recourse to gaining political power. Aristotle was very wary of the kind of political abuses that were possible within a democracy. He believed (as did Cicero) that every person should be respected in their property. Not respecting the property rights of people was a sure way to bring about revolution. Is this no longer a problem in our American republic? If you think that, guess again. If a party is harboring socialists that do not respect the above fundamental human right of property, you know the same situation that Aristotle and Cicero wrote about is possible even today. Aristotle mentions in more than one place that democracies often descend into very specific abuses. Often it came in the form of some politician scapegoating the well-to-do. This is exemplified in the following quote:\u201cFrom democracy tyrants have borrowed the art of making war upon the notables and destroying them secretly or openly, or of exiling them because they are rivals and stand in the way of their power; and also because plots against them are contrived by men of this class, who either want to rule or escape subjection.\u201dThis applies also to those who are wealthy as Aristotle also makes clear:\u201cRevolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance of demagogues, who either in their private capacity lay information against rich men until they compel them to combine.. or coming forward in public they stir up the people against them.\u201dOf course, the above has been a notable element of communist and socialist countries in the modern world. This is a risk of democracy. He noted numerous examples where democracy would shift into oligarchy and back again \u2013 all eventually descending into tyranny. Aristotle was incredibly critical of a pure democracy. This is where the majority have absolute control over the minority. Aristotle calls this the worst form of tyranny. In a pure democracy, 51% of the people have absolute control over 49% of the people. Interestingly enough, the percentages just provided are pretty close to what we have here between Liberals and Conservatives respectively (not taking into account moderates like myself) in America. Unsurprisingly, many of those connected to the American political party that takes it's name from democracy, often do support pure democratic ideals, where even the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be open to popular vote. The mitigating control to this pure democracy is what Aristotle calls the constitutional government. He includes the constitutional government under the heading of democracy, but he undoubtedly considered them distinct. The constitutional government is more what we would term today a constitutional republic (technically, democracy and republic are the same in ancient Greek sources, but in modern parlance they are distinct). This is what we have here in the United States. Indeed, Aristotle saw this as the best form of government. This is exemplified by the following quote:\u201cFor two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom and equality mean the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation.\u201dAristotle saw that a balance needed to be struck between law (i.e. constitution) and freedom (i.e. democracy). Losing this balance can be catastrophic as this following quote make clear:\u201cOligarchy or democracy, although a departure from the most perfect form, may yet be a good enough government, but if any one attempts to push the principles of either to an extreme, he will begin by spoiling the government and end by having none at all\u2026 for when by laws carried to excess one or other element in the state is ruined, the constitution is ruined.\u201dAristotle knew full well that pure democracies gave way to anarchy and then to oligarchy. He was suspicious of democracies for this reason. In democracies, everyone wants to be equal, but in the words of George Orwell, some want to be more equal than others. Part of the problem for Aristotle and other political thinkers of his day was to develop a system that would minimize, if not eliminate, inequities in a populace, and allow them a role in government, without sacrificing more competent voices for less competent voices. This may appear shocking, but one should keep in mind that in Aristotle's point of view, not everyone was equally competent to share in government, even if he were to grant that everyone is equal as far as the category of species goes. Obviously, the ancient Greek attempt to minimize incompetent say in government is not correct, but one has to at the same time acknowledge that a vast percentage of the population that exists in any society (and in any period of time) are not competent enough to have any political power. Very few people in a given population are knowledgeable enough to have an informed opinion on government. Aristotle, with other Greeks, probably assumed if one had gained a certain position or status, it indicated more competence; men were seen as more competent mentally than women; slaves lacked the status and education to be citizens; children were not yet competent prior to proper education. Education was seen as being fundamental to Aristotle's view of governmental longevity. I provide this quote of Aristotle as an example of his position:\u201cBut of all the things which I have mentioned, that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the form of government, and yet in our day this principle is universally neglected.\u201dWe need to appreciate that Greeks like Aristotle were concerned about the rule of an ignorant populace. We must acknowledge this while also condemning their attempts at controlling this through such an unjust method. Aristotle seems to acknowledge above that even those who were citizens were often ignorant. A tyranny of the majority happens when a populace is too ignorant and too self-seeking to make sound political decisions. The American founding fathers set up a very particular system to curb the tyranny of the majority. Ignorant factions of a country can easily become tribalist and disinterested in the health of society as a whole. This is a precursor to social unrest and civil war, i.e. what Aristotle terms revolution. What happens, for instance, when a disenfranchised group gains citizenship and every societal benefit that comes with citizenship? For some of these, this development will be seen as an adequate if not an optimal outcome. For others, it will simply not be good enough. They may then insist that they need special rights that other citizens don't enjoy for them to feel equal and to make up for any feelings of past societal marginalization. Aristotle says this:\u201cThe universal and chief cause of this revolutionary feeling has been mentioned already; viz. The desire of equality, when men think that they are equal to others that have more than themselves; or, again, the desire of inequality and superiority, when conceiving themselves to be superior they think that they have not more but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which may or may not be just. Inferiors revolt in order that they may be equal, and equals that they may be superior.\u201dAristotle attributed the revolutionary feeling to these factors that do not need to be based in reality; they only need to be perceived as true. What is at play here? The same ignorant human tendency Cicero also took note of: the tendency of people to be self-seeking and more concerned with superiority and not equality, even when claiming that they are only seeking equality. Once equality is attained, the wise and good will consider this adequate, but those who are neither wise nor good will not consider this adequate. This is not an archaic and inapplicable human tendency, it is still very much present in democracies. Pure democracy is mob rule. Can a democracy be a healthy breeding ground for political parties that harbor socialists, communists and anarchists? Indeed, it can. Having a constitution is a safeguard against these kinds of corrupting influences. Aristotle was also concerned about the wearing away of a constitution. Removing tenets little by little over time. Aristotle says:\u201cAgain, the revolution may be accomplished by small degrees; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution through neglect of a small matter...\u201dAnd again says in relation to Aristocratic constitutional government (I doubt he would consider the effects to be any different than in a democratic constitutional government):\u201cThe citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, and so with greater ease the government change something else which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of the state.\u201d One can certainly find an example of this sort of thing in this country recently. Not too long ago, a president instituted something called the Patriot Act that was a serious breach of the constitution. This allowed data collection and other things that compromised the rights of citizens. Aristotle was aware that in his day, tyrants utilized informants to infiltrate almost every aspect of societal life. These informants were the data collectors of Aristotle's day. Aristotle knew rightly that these are the tactics of tyrants and they are not desirable for a free society. Interestingly enough, he also noted that tyrants often attempted to keep the populace focused on things not pertinent to their role in government; these could take the form of fighting foreign wars and/or infighting between groups within a society. I leave it to the reader to decide if this still happens and if this sort of thing is still relevant in today's democracies. The preceding are the thoughts I had while reading this. Every review is simply a collection of my thoughts on anything I read. I am very far from believing that what Aristotle wrote about is irrelevant today. Indeed, I feel quite the opposite. Like the Nicomachean Ethics, which was the preceding volume to the Politics, Aristotle believed in moderation. He believed in a political balance between freedom and law, democracy and constitutional government. He was suspicious of extremes. I think that was an astute appraisal of politics. We would do well to take the same position in regards to politics today. It may be too much to hope when considering that I am a moderate Libertarian that the reader will see this as an adequate defense of political moderation, but hopefully the fact that this isn't a new idea and was the position of thinkers in the past may give it some merit. I am giving the book a 4 star review. The book caused me to reflect quite a bit. I reject Aristotle's caste system where certain people are denied citizenship and rights. I also find his defense of infanticide incredibly abhorrent, but it is hardly surprising when one considers his position on the value of children.",
            "This is quite a turn away from the optimistic we can figure it all out tone of the Nicomachean Ethics. In trying to confront both what a state is and how it functions",
            "Political philosophy is a fundamental part of the legacy of the ancient Greeks. The questions of distribution of power, public justice and order, rights and duties, citizenship, the efficient use of resources and national security, lay at the heart of this tradition. In a civilization of unparallel political constitutional creativity and diversity, legendary lawgivers and great political theorists, Aristotle is pushing the discussion further to reach matters we still debate today.What seems most essential to Aristotle\u2019s political thought, before any talk of the perfect constitution, is the fact that a real state is the one where citizens take turns in holding power. Aristotle dismisses states where power is held by one man and the rest have a slave like status. He associates this situation with non Greeks, who lack spirit and are slavish, especially the Asians. If taking turn in ruling among the citizens is the backbone of any state, the requirements of citizenship are a much complicated matter. The occupation, wealth, virtue and education of citizens are all parameters one should take in consideration in order to address the question of the ideal constitution.Faithful to his analytical and teleological spirit, Aristotle discusses the aims of a constitution in the first place. Of course to be happy is what any human being seeks, this goes for an association of humans too. Now happiness does not depend solely on accidents of Fortune, such as great beauty for individuals or natural resources for states. Happiness does not depend on chance and is not waited for passively. It is the active exercise of virtue and wisdom, practical wisdom in particular. A good constitution is the one adapted to what chance throws at you randomly. It is also not a fixed set of laws, which can be used by all states. Instead, he pulls us back to ancient Greece where every state makes its own constitution, adapt it to its social, geographical and ideological peculiarities. It is also changeable, adaptable with reforms to keep going with new configurations, of course in the limits of a certain degree of stability.Again, with Aristotle\u2019s Ethics in the background, the way for an ideal constitution is the middle one. So he favors what he calls a mixed constitution. He discusses at great length the advantages and limitations of the systems invented by his time : democracies, oligarchies, tyrannies, monarchies\u2026 he lists reasons for their stability and instability, their adaptability to different levels of prosperity and the nature of their populations, to come up with remedies for each of their problems. So an oligarchy must be combined with elements of democracy to make it more stable and so on\u2026 According to Aristotle, political upheaval is the result of some groups of people demanding equality because they think they are inferior, or others who are not satisfied when being equaled to others because they think they are superior. Equality is not justice, for the simple reason that people are not equal in all aspects. Justice in Democracy is arithmetic, what is just is what the majority believe it is so, while in oligarchy more power is given to property owning individuals to decide what is just.These inequalities seem to be taking for granted by Aristotle, which can be very confusing to a modern reader. If class struggle in the Marxist sense is the least of Aristotle\u2019s problems, he does admit that in democracies the rule of the majority can lead to them harassing the rich and confiscating their properties, while in oligarchies, men in power tend to use it to augment their influence and thus form power groups. Aristotle does not talk about democracy in the way we moderns think of it, as the most perfect system there is to bring some kind of almost divine justice and equality to all. He does not seem to raise it above oligarchies or tyrannies or even monarchies, and puts much emphasis on its deviations. These systems, although deemed by moderns as inherently unjust, are viable if implemented in the right circumstances. ",
            "In Politics, Aristotle theorized that in a perfect world, a monarchy would be a benevolent dictatorship, an aristocracy would be rule by the virtuous and democracy would be rule by the people. But because of human frailty, monarchy actually becomes tyranny, aristocracy actually becomes oligarchy and pure democracy actually becomes mob rule. The practical solution is a form of government that mixes elements of a single ruler, rule by the few and majority rule.This idea survived and evolved, and eventually the English developed a system of government with a monarch, a House of Lords and a House of Commons. Later, a system of government was created in the United States with a separation of powers among a President, a Senate and a House of Representatives.How amazing that Aristotle wrote a book so long ago that has had such influence on world history right up to the present day!",
            "Politics is intrinsic to human life, as Aristotle knew well. One of the most famous quotes from this classic work of political philosophy is \u201c\u1f41 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd.\u201d This Greek phrase is often translated as \u201cMan is by nature a political animal,\u201d though I prefer to think of it as saying that \u201cHumankind is by nature a political species.\u201d However you translate Aristotle\u2019s words, the fact remains that, 2400 years after Aristotle wrote the Politics in the 4th century B.C., we in the 21st century A.D. are still comparing societies in terms of their political structures, just as Aristotle did. As long as citizens care about the shape their nations take, Aristotle\u2019s Politics will remain relevant.Regular readers of Aristotle\u2019s work will detect echoes of other Aristotelian texts while reading the Politics. For instance, I hear echoes of De Anima, with its declaration that human beings are the only animals with souls, in the way Aristotle in the Politics follows up on his statement about humankind as a political species by declaring that \u201cobviously man is a political animal in a sense in which a bee is not, or any other gregarious animal. Nature\u2026has endowed man alone among the animals with the power of speech\u201d (p. 60) \u2013 a classically Aristotelian declaration. Contemporary researchers who study communication among the more intelligent of our fellow animals \u2013 apes, dolphins, whales \u2013 might take issue with Aristotle\u2019s claim. But then Aristotle, like any good scientist, reasons from the verifiable and replicable evidence available to him, and then sets forth his conclusions \u2013 knowing that someday, future scientists will challenge his findings, the way a young Aristotle challenged his old teacher Plato.For Aristotle, it follows that, as humankind is a political species, human beings will inevitably organize themselves into societies that will organize themselves according to some sort of set of rules. For the remainder of the Politics, Aristotle reviews the relations among different groups of human beings, looks at the constitutions of various Greek states of his time, and considers the different options available to those who are trying to set up a state: democracy, aristocracy, oligarchy, tyranny. And the stakes are high: as Aristotle points out, \u201ca state\u2019s purpose is not merely to provide a living, but to make a life that is good\u201d (p. 196). Think about it: if you had two options, and only two, would you rather be a citizen of Sweden, or of North Korea?As he is considering the position of the citizen in a wide variety of states \u2013 Athens, Carthage, Crete, Sparta, Syracuse \u2013 it is good that Aristotle provides a definition of the citizen: \u201c[O]ne who has a share in ruling and in being ruled\u2026.So far as the best constitution is concerned, he is a man who is able and who chooses to rule and to be ruled with a view to a life that is in accordance with virtue\u201d (p. 213). Aside from its restrictiveness in terms of gender \u2013 Aristotle\u2019s attitude toward women is always one of the weaknesses of his philosophical system \u2013 it is a definition of citizenship that is still applicable today.The first-time reader of the Politics may be surprised to discover that Aristotle, like his mentor Plato, is not at all enthusiastic about democracy. Today, people around the world use the terms \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d to describe what is assumed to be the most desirable state for a society: one in which each citizen has equal rights, and no citizen has more rights than others. International organizations like Freedom House issue regular reports that indicate which countries of the world are most or least free, meaning most or least democratic. Aristotle, by contrast, did not think about democracy that way. Readers of Aristotle know that he always follows \u201cthe principle of the middle way\u201d (p. 330); and for him, the form of government that is most to be desired is what he calls the polity",
            "An interesting treatise, but I can see why only those interested in political theory return to it.",
            "Come on Aristotle! You really wrote a lame book man. I'm gonna have to go read Plato's Republic to shake the funk out. I mean hey, I know you're supposed to be one of the world's greatest thinkers and you were the founder of formal logic and all. But dude, your ethics suck. What the jazz are you talking about in this book about how everyone needs to be ruled, and those who lack the rationality to rule themselves need to be ruled by others? I mean, I guess that ends up happening to people who lack rationality as they blindly follow groups like the Republican/Tea Party and the propaganda of the corporate-controlled media. But NOT COOL.Slavery = bad. ...Sadly, it appears that your words were prophetic as most of us have become wage slaves. And I'm not sure about the city being more important than family which in turn is more important than the individual. Tottle talks about politics being more like an organism instead of a machine and that it's a collection of parts where none can exist without the others. Aristotle said the city (polis) is not just about laws and economic stability, but it's about pursuing the good and noble life. He stated the goal was to perform noble acts: The political partnership must be regarded",

            "Os especialistas e entendidos no assunto dizem que Arist\u00f3teles \u00e9 uma das figuras intelectuais mais importantes de todos os tempos \u2014 que ele \u00e9, juntamente com Plat\u00e3o, um dos fundadores da raz\u00e3o ocidental.Dizem os especialistas tamb\u00e9m que a \u201cPol\u00edtica\u201d, do mesmo Arist\u00f3teles, \u00e9 um dos livros mais importantes j\u00e1 escritos, um dos textos seminais da reflex\u00e3o pol\u00edtica.Mas, olhando ao nosso redor, n\u00f3s, homens do s\u00e9culo XXI, vemos que nossa realidade, nosso mundo, \u00e9 muito diferente daquele dum grego que viveu no s\u00e9culo IV a.C.. Temos estados-na\u00e7\u00f5es, megal\u00f3poles, viagens intercontinentais, bombas at\u00f4micas, conflitos multi\u00e9tnicos, comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em tempo real, voto eletr\u00f4nico, f\u00e1bricas e ind\u00fastrias, bolsa de mercadorias e futuros, em suma, nosso mundo \u00e9 muito mais complexo e intrincado do que o das pequeninas cidades-estado do tempo de Arist\u00f3teles.De que modo, ent\u00e3o, a sua \u201cPol\u00edtica\u201d pode nos dizer algo de valor ainda hoje? De que modo a sua leitura n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 apenas um fetiche de antiqu\u00e1rios?Pois bem, a leitura direta do texto, sem atravessadores e intermedi\u00e1rios, joga no ch\u00e3o, sem d\u00f3 nem piedade, todas as nossas expectativas, todas as nossas tolas ilus\u00f5es.Sim, \u00e9 verdade, Arist\u00f3teles viveu muito tempo atr\u00e1s e n\u00e3o conheceu o facebook, nem o whatsapp; mas ele conheceu algo mais importante, mais fundamental \u2014 ele conheceu a natureza humana e, a partir dela, a natureza das associa\u00e7\u00f5es formadas pelos homens.\u00c9 realmente de fazer cair o queixo se dar conta de que as descri\u00e7\u00f5es de Arist\u00f3teles \u00e0 respeito do comportamento dos homens, seus sentimentos, seus instintos, seus preconceitos, v\u00edcios e virtudes, se aplicam, com pequenos ajustes, aos homens do nosso tempo.Mais do que isso: as descri\u00e7\u00f5es dos v\u00e1rios tipos de regimes pol\u00edticos, da natureza da cidadania, das causas e origens das revoltas e crises sociais, dos motivos que contribuem para a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades pol\u00edticas s\u00e3o absolutamente matadoras, servindo, sem maiores dificuldades, para descrever tamb\u00e9m fen\u00f4menos pol\u00edticos e sociais que est\u00e3o ocorrendo agora, neste exato momento, em pleno s\u00e9culo XXI.O que Arist\u00f3teles fez, do ponto de vista intelectual, \u00e9 simplesmente monstruoso \u2014 nada mais do que criar, a partir de observa\u00e7\u00f5es e an\u00e1lises duma precis\u00e3o a toda prova, um ferramental que permite o diagn\u00f3stico de praticamente qualquer ajuntamento de homens neste mund\u00e3o de Deus.Mas, cuidado! N\u00e3o pense que Arist\u00f3teles \u00e9 como os nossos \u201cprofessores de filosofia\u201d ou \u201ccientistas sociais\u201d de hoje em dia. Nada mais errado do que ter essa imagem na cabe\u00e7a. Arist\u00f3teles \u00e9 um fil\u00f3sofo em sentido pleno \u2014 e dos de mais grosso calibre. Isso significa que ele simplesmente n\u00e3o est\u00e1 preocupado com os teus sentimentos, com as tuas id\u00e9ias preconcebidas, com as tuas opini\u00f5es, com a tua id\u00e9ia de \u201cum mundo melhor \u00e9 poss\u00edvel\u201d. Ele est\u00e1 pouco se lixando para essas babaquices p\u00f3s-modernas. O que interessa ao Fil\u00f3sofo \u2014 e na Idade M\u00e9dia Arist\u00f3teles era o \u201cfil\u00f3sofo\u201d por antonom\u00e1sia \u2014 \u00e9 o conhecimento da realidade das coisas, e, no caso espec\u00edfico da \u201cPol\u00edtica\u201d, o conhecimento da realidade da vida em sociedade.Portanto, n\u00e3o espere utopias, planos mirabolantes de reforma social, diatribes contra os ricos e coisas desse tipo que s\u00e3o produzidas, todos dias, de maneira incessante, pelas nossas madra\u00e7as intelectuais \u00e0s quais damos o nome pomposo de \u201cuniversidades\u201d.Arist\u00f3teles delineia \u2014 \u00e9 verdade \u2014 uma cidade ideal, uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica ideal. Mas isso no mesmo esp\u00edrito em que Plat\u00e3o a fez \u2014 n\u00e3o como um plano a ser implementado na pr\u00e1tica, mas como uma r\u00e9gua de medida, um crit\u00e9rio que permitisse a compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as sociedades atualmente existentes.Arist\u00f3teles \u00e9, no sentido estrito da express\u00e3o, um cientista, um pesquisador, um intelectual. Isso significa que para ele o importante \u2014 diferentemente do que para Marx, por exemplo \u2014 \u00e9 compreender o mundo, entender a realidade, e n\u00e3o transform\u00e1-la.O realismo do homem \u00e9 t\u00e3o brutal, t\u00e3o sem meias palavras, que ele reconhece \u2014 e n\u00e3o tem vergonha nenhuma de dizer \u2014 que a vida neste mundo sublunar, nesta verdadeira caverna plat\u00f4nica, \u00e9 \u2014 para usar a express\u00e3o de Eric Voegelin \u2014 \u201cmiserable enough\u201d. Diante disso, o m\u00e1ximo que se pode almejar, de maneira realista, \u00e9 que as sociedades, mal ajambradas e claudicantes todas elas, sejam minimamente est\u00e1veis, n\u00e3o sofrendo com revolu\u00e7\u00f5es e crises intestinas o tempo todo.N\u00e3o que Arist\u00f3teles seja um brutamontes intelectual, de jeito nenhum. Apenas ele n\u00e3o tem interesse a n\u00e3o ser na realidade efetiva das coisas, naquilo que se passa, de fato, na vida dos homens e das sociedades. E se, para desencavar a verdade e traz\u00ea-la \u00e0 luz do dia, ele tiver de demolir as id\u00e9ias e opini\u00f5es alheias, pode ter certeza, irm\u00e3o \u2014 ele o far\u00e1. Nem as opini\u00f5es de Plat\u00e3o foram poupadas do exame severo desse erudito de integridade intelectual inabal\u00e1vel.Mas volto a dizer \u2014 essa severidade n\u00e3o implica insensibilidade, muito pelo contr\u00e1rio. Arist\u00f3teles \u00e9 duma sensibilidade nas suas observa\u00e7\u00f5es, dum bom-senso nas suas an\u00e1lises e opini\u00f5es, que \u00e9 quase imposs\u00edvel \u2014 falo por experi\u00eancia pr\u00f3pria \u2014 n\u00e3o se ver a todo o tempo concordando com as pondera\u00e7\u00f5es desse grande mestre de vida que ele \u00e9.Sim, diferentemente do que muitos pensam, especialmente na academia, o Fil\u00f3sofo ainda tem muito \u2014 muito mesmo! \u2014 a nos dizer.

            "\u201cMan is a political animal.\u201d-The perfect springboard for Aristotle's political tome. The book is largely divided, though not perfectly sectioned off, into sections concerning his political philosophy and analysis. His philosophy was a little difficult to ascertain. His idea of a citizen is severely limited, arguing that men are born to \u201crule or be ruled\u201d. He says that the same means are needed to make a good man as a good constitution. And his insistence that the whole comes before the parts (the polis before the individual) left me, as a modern reader, pretty skeptical. He seems to think that the individual can only be fulfilled in a political setting. The city is not organized to simply provide protection, but to enable the citizen (again, the few who qualify) to obtain the good life. But then he thinks the \u201cgood life\u201d, which is to be attained through participation in government, is one of leisure?? It seems to me that a life of leisure can only be built on the backs of those who are willing (or made, in the case of slavery) to provide such a life, meaning very few people could obtain this. I didn't quite get how all of this is supposed to work. But I have not read  Nicomachean Ethics yet, so my lack of understanding may lie somewhere between the two books.His political analysis of different forms of government, in their ideal and practical forms, was interesting reading (mostly). He had an intense knowledge of the constitutions of his day and their strengths and weaknesses. He discusses how different conflicts within different classes leads to constitutional changes. His comments in this section on changes from aristocracy to democracy truly made me think of the French Revolution, which made think he was mostly on target in these sections, but I am no political analyst. Mostly, I just appreciated the groundwork he laid for the future conversations that lead to our constitution. On his treatment of slavery: I could not help but compare the differences between the Ancient Hebrew laws on slavery and Aristotle's comments. As I hope others will understand the importance of not reading ancient texts like the Bible with modern sentiments, I tried to offer the same understanding to Aristotle. But he really lost me here. He constantly referred to slaves as irrational creatures. There seemed to be something at work here, for he said perhaps some are wrongfully enslaved, but mostly he felt their plight was just and to their benefit. Ancient Hebrew laws also were to the benefit of the \u201cslave\u201d, but in the interest of setting them free from debt, and ultimately, to be free to leave. Ancient Hebrew law looked progressive compared to Aristotle's comments. Aristotle made me laugh with this comment, \u201cNo one in his youth resents being ruled.\u201d HA. I thought Aristotle had children, but Wikipedia must be mistaken...To sum up with a word to the wise he says,\u201cNot all democratic or Oligarchic measures are calculated to ensure the permanence of democracy or oligarchy.\u201d The cardinal importance of educating citizens to live and act in the spirit of the constitution cannot be underestimated. \u201cThis is too often neglected, especially in extreme democracies which encourage the idea of 'living as one likes'\u201d.

            "To anyone who is interested in this book: make sure you read Ethics first.This is the first Aristotle I have read and I have more questions than opinions. It might turn out that this review is a total stupidity but -- I've done worse (plus I'm a heartless bitch). So here we go.0) The nicknames divine Plato and daemonic Aristotle.I heard this notion from Leo Strauss in his lecture on Symposium and I kept wondering what this could mean. Still have no idea what it could mean -- that Plato is as divine as those manipulative a-hole Olympians and Aristotle as straightforward and inhibiting as daemon? Unlikely",
            "This was my first political science book, and I was surprised to see it becoming a real page turner after the first two hundred pages. I had no idea how important the middle group of people are in a state. I don't know how much this corresponds to the present, but you hear on the news how the middle class is disappearing, the rich are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer, and now all of a sudden there is cause for alarm because Aristotle says this is how nations become unraveled!The entire time Aristotle was talking about the ideal state, I really got the feeling of where he considered himself in the hierarchy - as part of the elite. He talked about the polity but to me it felt like he was placating to the poor and middle class so as to maintain the current system, and not for the sake of it being the best state. A good example would be when he talked about farmers not having the time to work in government versus the rich who do, so the rich will rule and the poor and middle classes will be able to scrutinize without having the time or resources to get involved. It seems this is a more practical way to look at a society. We want to believe that we live in a place where everyone has a vote and we're all equal, but like Aristotle says, we're not equal. People with money and education are worth more to a state than a poor person with no education.Well that's kind of depressing. Reading this book makes me want to hide in the comfort of eastern philosophy where we are all one, where the illusion of ego and status melt away and all we are left with is a single consciousness.What else. There are a lot of subjects to tackle after reading this book, but I'll stop here. I admire what Aristotle was able to put together. On a separate note, in Plato's Crito",
            "Aristotle speaks through the ages in his classic Politics. Many of his observations, especially those on education, were prescient and are as relevant today as they were 2400 years ago. Aristotle examines different kinds of government and the advantages and dangers of each. He includes insight into many of the problems of democratic government that would be left unsolved for 2000 years- and some that remain unsolved. Aristotle not only predicts the dangers of socialism and communism, but also their downfalls. He examines public spirit, justice, and the meaning of life. This book is a rare watershed moment of in the study human nature. While Aristotle's attempts to understand the scientific underpinnings of the universe via philosophy have been disproved, his philosophical and logical examinations of man, the political animal, are timeless and relevant in an age when short-lived mini-philosophies and faux-profundity pass for intellectual undertakings.",
            "Such a pity that today's modern civilizations are built upon such one-dimensional, racist, sexist, ableist and hierarchic ideas of state, humanity, and nature. If politicians would read something else instead of this book, maybe things would have been very different than now. No wonder, that 'war' has been usually the determinate factor of the natural and normal discourses and traditions up until now.Why is Aristotle so obsessed with determining the 'natural state' of 'everything'? As if, as soon as they reach the natural state of everything (the natural that Aristotle wants) things will be in balance and equality! and humans will live happily ever after (with slaves of course). No wonder he was the teacher of Alexander III of Macedon (a.k.a great) the greatest murderer in human history.",
            "Quite possibly one of the worst books I've read in recent memory. It was actually painful trying to finish reading this book. Aristotle's words are obtuse, his arguments vague and it all just makes me want to fall asleep (I have actually fallen asleep numerous times while reading this book due to sheer boredom and uninterest). I'm sure there is troves of important information among these pages of gobbledygook, but I think Aristotle was just too galaxy brained for it to be comprehensible to the modern reader. I think I learned more about Politics from Cliffnotes and Sparknotes than Aristotle's own words.My fellow tutorial classmates warned me that they hated this book going into it, having read it in previous classes. Sadly, I now agree with them. My heart goes out to any future political science/philosophy students that will have to endure this madness.",
            "\u00c7eviri gayet m\u00fckemmel.Ben Aristoteles\u2019in bizzat kendisini be\u011fenmedi\u011fim ve hazzetmedim i\u00e7in 1 verdim.yoksa \u00e7eviri harika",
            "Evaluating my experience with the book, without daring to say that Aristotle was anything less than a five star intellect.",
            "There are so many consequential ideas in this book that it's amazing it's not required reading in Western classrooms anymore. The Benjamin Jowett translation is easily accessible in many formats. Perhaps just as it was lost to the Middle Ages until rediscovered and translated into Latin in the 12th century it is lost to today.Prerequisites for reading this book are Plato's Republic and The Laws",
            "The work of Aristotle is a good source about the types of regimes prevailing in antiquity. The author describes both the disadvantages and the advantages of such regimes. The interesting thing is that in many places you can see that socialism and its related ideas are nothing new, because the author repeatedly mentions even with regimes that tried to set the equality of humans or plunder the rich to the poor. If someone is interested in various forms of governance in ancient Greece is recommended if you do not I do not recommend. According to me it is worth to pay attention to several issues:1. Authorisation of slavery people who are slaves by nature. Unfortunately, Aristotle did not write exactly why nature allows some people to servitude, but not others. Human nature is one and we are all humans, unless someone wants to voluntarily relinquish their rights. Therefore, there should be no tolerance for slavery.2. According to the author percent is bad, because according to him money using the percentage born themselves, which is contrary to nature. I would like to post here a series of profanity expressing my indignation at this idiocy, but it is not the right place. Unfortunately, in the times of Aristotle, there was no such thing as Economics, so people usually regarded percent for evil, but it is not. What then is the percentage? The percentage is premium for the risk and the payment for refraining from consumption by the lender. The Austrian School of Economics (ASE) functions such concept as time preference. It is a measure of how people covet The present-day goods over future goods. A person with a low time preference is willing to save more",
            "\u201cWe should take it, indeed, that pretty well everything else too has been discovered many times, or rather an infinite number of times, in the long course of history. For our needs are likely to teach the necessities, and once they are present, the things that add refinement and luxury to life quite naturally develop. Hence we should suppose that the same is true of matters pertaining to constitutions. That all such matters are ancient is indicated by the facts about Egypt. For the Egyptians are held to be the most ancient people, and they have always had laws and a political organization. Therefore, one should make adequate use of what has been discovered, but also try to investigate whatever has been overlooked.\u201d (Book VII) "

            "No sufr\u00ed el libro porque es agradable, ameno y con algunos di\u00e1logos que merecen la pena. Sin embargo, gran parte de la lectura la hice con cara de \u00a1no me lo creo! Que poca verosimilitud tienen sus personajes. Una campesina desplazada y hu\u00e9rfana caracterizada como mojigata e ingenua se convierte de la noche a la ma\u00f1ana en una mujer sin escr\u00fapulos que se desenvuelve h\u00e1bilmente en las esferas altas de la sociedad. No hay ninguna transformaci\u00f3n, ninguna justificaci\u00f3n, ninguna l\u00f3gica. Est\u00e1 lejos de ser una mutaci\u00f3n razonable producto de experiencias o cambios internos, son acciones arbitrarias sin ninguna coherencia con el personaje dibujado inicialmente. Lo mismo ocurre con el sacerdote, y en general sus personajes est\u00e1n faltos de solidez. El texto est\u00e1 cargado de descripciones simplonas y escenas cursis. Algunos momentos parecen sacados de comedias rom\u00e1nticas y otros de nefastas pel\u00edculas de terror. El autor recurre sin reparos a la trillada escena de la chica pose\u00edda que intenta provocar al sacerdote con frases lujuriosas y que generan conflicto en el que se sabe pecador. Me quedo con la manida representaci\u00f3n cinematogr\u00e1fica antes que con la escena dibujada por Mario Mendoza. Satan\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n adolece de una revisi\u00f3n concienzuda de lo que se escribe, es decir, no hay un juicioso ejercicio investigativo. Despu\u00e9s del episodio de violaci\u00f3n, a Mar\u00eda le hacen pruebas que le aseguran que no le transmitieron ninguna infecci\u00f3n. Esto no puede saberse de inmediato con las pruebas, cuya finalidad en el momento es otra. Al igual que esa, hay otras inconsistencias en la informaci\u00f3n que revelan poca fundamentaci\u00f3n.

Para gustos los colores y entre gustos no hay disgustos. Sin embargo, dudo que la respuesta sea tan simple. Algo m\u00e1s debe haber detr\u00e1s de la buena acogida.

            "The first half of this was very good indeed, and I was thinking that it would continue in that vein. But then things began to get rather sketchy, and a bit puzzling as well (eg, Gene Clark, who was portrayed as being very skittish about his affair with her, suddenly shows up in the front row of a M&P concert with a big grin on his face). Certainly it's difficult to figure out what the writer is thinking sometimes, and her moral compass doesn't always seem to be too highly magnetized. Okay, so she was young and suddenly all this fame and fortune was thrust upon her; sure, anybody could spin out of orbit with all of that. But this was after all written some 20 years later, and you'd think that the older (and wiser?) Michelle would kick in with a bit more commentary about her younger and sillier self. She seems all too often (when not acting like a spoiled brat) to be a vapid blonde.We hear that she and her husband agree to stay together (more or less for the sake of the group). And then that's it. No more accounts of fighting or of the tension between members...it all just sort of segues into a fuzzy-headed sequence of parties and nights out on the town. All she can really seem to do after a while is talk about all her nifty new furniture and dinner plates. It was the honesty of the first part of the book which made it compelling",

            "Loved reading the wild band stories. What a time to be alive.",
            "Writing Style: 3.5/5Overall Rating: 4/5 A must-read for anybody whos a fan of Michelle Phillips, The Mamas and the Papas, or 60's music in general.In this autobiography, Michelle Phillip's outlines how The Mamas and the Papas came to be, and we get to learn about her own early life and how she came to meet John Phillips, Cass Elliot, and Denny Doherty.The book was nice, short, and to the point. You hear more about the fights, the songs, the affairs, the good times, and the bad times. Not only that, you get that amazing wholesome feel for the 60s (Ah, how I wish I lived then!).This book was overall, great. Although the writing was a bit flat, you can't blame Phillips. Obviously, she's more of a singer and actress than a writer. But that's not to say she can't write. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and learned more than ever about one of my favorite groups of all time. Michelle is considered one of the purest sopranos of all time",
            "This is an interesting read about the Mamas and the Papas that describes how the group originated and developed. Phillips is not a writer and repeats herself at times but her story describes what and how it all happened. She was there and involved. Worth reading if you are interested in this group. These young talented people worked hard and went through many life experiences for which they were unprepared even when they attained the fame they sought. The music they made was incredible. John Phillips was a perfectionist who knew how to blend their voices to achieve that wonderful sound that became so popular. They all knew that at some point the group would disband. Not long after, Cass died far too soon but she proved to herself and others that she could become a solo star."

Following the development of scientific ideas about these dramatic events, Macdougall traces the lives of many of the brilliant and intriguing characters who have contributed to the evolving understanding of how ice ages come about. As it explains how the great Pleistocene Ice Age has shaped the earth's landscape and influenced the course of human evolution, Frozen Earth also provides a fascinating look at how science is done, how the excitement of discovery drives scientists to explore and investigate, and how timing and chance play a part in the acceptance of new scientific ideas. Macdougall describes the awesome power of cataclysmic floods that marked the melting of the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age. He probes the chilling evidence for \"Snowball Earth,\" an episode far back in the earth's past that may have seen our planet encased in ice from pole to pole. He discusses the accumulating evidence from deep-sea sediment cores, as well as ice cores from Greenland and the Antarctic, that suggests fast-changing ice age climates may have directly impacted the evolution of our species and the course of human migration and civilization. Frozen Earth also chronicles how the concept of the ice age has gripped the imagination of scientists for almost two centuries. It offers an absorbing consideration of how current studies of Pleistocene climate may help us understand earth's future climate changes, including the question of when the next glacial interval will occur.",

            "Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages, is a great book about the Ice age and the gradual acknowledgement made by scientific society of the existence of ice ages. Doug Macdougall, the author of Frozen Earth, mentions different scientific and non-scientific figures who have contributed in making the theory of Ice age. He writes about how they comprehended the causes of ice age and the evidence current landscape provides. He talks about Louis Agassiz frequently because of this contribution of putting forward the Theory of Ice Age for the first time. His main objective for this book was to tell stories about glaciation of Earth and how mankind came to recognize it and the importance of glaciation in shaping Earth.Macdougall gives reasons and his own critiques on many scientific discoveries he mentions in the book. This makes it more than a story and more like a narrative with comments. He illustrates in this book that any conclusions made on Ice Age was dependent on deep observations made by many naturalists, philosophers even and scientists. Some of these observations at times tend to be scientific. However, he explains all of them well enough that any person with little scientific background can understand it. As the book progresses, the contents gets more and more scientific which can be frustrating at times. But it does not happen too often that one would want to keep the book down. Also, for the first half of the book, in each chapter he mentions one important historical figure who contributed in understanding glaciation on Earth in the past. He writes their life history and as one moves from one figure to another, it sometimes does feel like he is deviating from the subject matter. Overall, Frozen Earth is an informative book. To anyone, who is interested in Ice Age or was fascinated with Ice Age movies and wanted to learn more about Ice Age, this is a worthy book to read. Moreover, this book can also be used in certain courses which focus on Earth\u2019s landscape. ",

            "This was a very decent, popular science level book about ice ages. Of course, if you are interested in ice ages you are essentially reading geology which is always a challenge for me as I find geology one of the harder sciences to read about (no pun intended, but embraced nonetheless). When reading geology, there is almost always an element of the history of how the geological propositions came about and the characters responsible for them, this book is no exception there. It concludes with a couple of chapters relating the information we have read about past ice ages and cycles of the earth with the recent history of the middle ages, our current situation on earth today and the possible futures. While the marine environment is not a primary focus for this book, world wide climate change, continental drift and ice ages are the very essence of marine history, so I am including it in my Marine collection.I found the twelve chapters to progress in a sensible order making the story of the ice ages linear and easy to follow,chapters 1 -4 were essentially the people who first hypothesised what might have happened, the slow discovery of continental shift, ice ages, glaciation on geological era. This section was a bit ponderous, but the stories of the geologists and their research made it readable enough.Chapters 5 - 9 expanded on the science behind causation; once you accept (more or less, with some scientific argument) that ice ages have occurred, that planetary cycles are a thing and that glaciation is an important part of planetary history, then people start asking why and how. So there chapters explore the possible mechanisms involved in ice ages past.Chapter 10 - 12 more or less related this information to us as a species. First they look at how the ice ages and inter-glacial periods may have influenced the evolution of species, then they look at the possible influence on Hominids leading to Homo Sapience, and this section was really interesting. We are then taken on a review of how changing climate affected society in the more recent past; the little ice age of medieval Europe, it is a period I have always been quite interested in and this section was fascinating to me. There was then a brief application of all this knowledge we had been given to the current state of the earth and future possibilities of global warming. At no stage did I feel preached at, at no stage did the author tell us what we should do about it all that was presented were the facts as we know them. This was extremely restful.I would recommend it to anyone with an armchair interest in geology, ice ages, climate change and similar."

            "My rating is based on the fact that this particular heroine isn't my kind of heroine. She's a double minded girl in the middle of a mess she helped created yet thumbing her snobby nose on the one who could help her. Moreover, her action often disagrees with what her mouth utters. Unfortunately, her transformation into a great pioneer woman did not convinced me that well since she still allowed circumstance to decide and talk for her. In the end she's still the spoiled brat that she was in the beginning.Otherwise, this could be a great book to anyone who does not mind the above heroine. Strong hero, enough intrigue to keep one reading, and interesting secondary characters. I heard lots of rave for this book that's why I picked it up.",
            "This was one sweet read! The author tells the story of Lila and Bishop, set sometime after the Civil War. the H/h have a one-night stand following Lila's brother's wedding. 3 months later, after receiving news she is pregnant, Bishop shows up at Lila's wedding to a man she doesn't love, marries her himself, and Lila is on her way to Colorado before you can count to 9.There are many surprises, as one might expect for a couple that really doesn't know each other well. Lila was raised in a stable Pennsylvania town, and finds herself in the wild west, trying to adapt to her new life.There are elements to this story that I really appreciated. a lot of thought went into the main and secondary characters, and it made for a rich reading experience. Lila does a lot of growing up, while Bishop adapts to the huge changes in his lifestyle as well.There is a lot of sexual tension, and the story has erotic elements and a few sweet love scenes. First published in 1996, it is not a new millennium erotic romance. Still, it is a fun, interesting, hot read, and I think is worth the time. It even made my re-read shelf!",
            "Ok I normally don't care for western style historical romance (unless it's by Diana Palmer or some Brenda Joyce) however I made an exception for this book and I was not disappointed!!! It was amazing! So full of fun drama and passion. What more could I ask for. The story starts at a wedding and its all about a marriage in order to give a baby a name! I would love to know about the other characters in this book and I will try to see if they have their own story as well. I will not spoil this book by telling you more. I recommend this book if you like sweet passionate and feisty hero and heroine. I will be keeping this and reading again for sure. ",

        "description": "Beauty is neither a history of art, nor a history of aesthetics but Umberto Eco draws on the histories of both these disciplines to define the ideas of beauty that have informed sensibilities from the classical world to modern times. In terms of form and style, Beauty has been conceived for a vast and diversified readership: taking in painting, sculpture, architecture, film, photography, the decorative arts, novels and poems, it offers a rich and intelligent panorama of this huge subject. It traces the philosophy of aesthetics through history and examines some of the many treatises that have sought to define it. Beauty is Umberto Eco at his most captivating and eclectic: we read not only of Botticelli and Michelangelo but of how the fashion of the 1960s owes much to ancient Egyptian dress, and how ancient Roman and eighteenth-century hairstyles have much in common. It makes the familiar new, and sheds a brilliant new light on the unfamiliar. Illustrated in full colour throughout and produced to the highest standards, Beauty is an indispensable book.",

            "Storia della bellezza = History of Beauty = On Beauty, 2nd ed, 2005, Umberto EcoBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it also has a lot to do with the beholder's cultural standards. In History of Beauty, renowned author Umberto Eco sets out to demonstrate how every historical era has had its own ideas about eye-appeal. History of Beauty is really about the history of philosophical and perceptual notions of perfection and how they have been applied to ideas and objects, as well as to the human body. This survey ranges over such themes as the mathematics of ideal proportions, the problem of representing ugliness, the fascination of the exotic and art for art's sake. Along the way, the text examines the intersection of standards of beauty with Christian belief, notions of the Sublime, the philosophies of Kant and Hegel, and bourgeois culture. More than 300 illustrations trace the history of Western art as it relates, in the broadest sense, to the topic of beauty.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646

            "Reading Eco\u2019s study On Beauty feels like visiting a Temple with very many chambers. In each room there are texts. There are also images, many of them too and of good quality and they are all photos of art pieces. During this visit we are accompanied by the talk of a commentator. He comments on the texts only. Not on the images. Each room corresponds to a period in the Quest of Beauty. In this pursuit we can also conceive each space as forming a petal of a different tone and shape, so that by the end of the journey we can see that this Temple has the appearance of a multi-faceted flower. And a beautiful flower it is.In the search for Beauty along Western history many questions have been raised.Where does Beauty originate? Is it in the things? And therefore is it made by man, or is it in Nature and made by god? If a god creates beauty, then what is this god? A concept, like Goodness? Or is it a being? If so, then what was his purpose? Or could man create it not in the things but out of the things? Who is this man (mostly man, sometimes woman) and what is his nature? Are all men capable of creating Beauty? Or is it only some \u2013 those who are endowed with a (divine) capacity, and we can call them \u2018artists\u2019? And those are the Artists \u2013 the beings who can create a (divine) entity \u2013 \u2018art\u2019? Or is beauty really created by the subject? Is it in front of you or is it in your eye \u2013 the shifting eye of the beholder? Can Beauty be measured? Indeed, is it proportion itself? Who measures those proportions? Does it form part of an overall scheme of things, the Harmonic Tutto? Or does it require another quality, such as individuality, and should therefore break the norms and surprise? What is its purpose? To elevate us to a higher, and ethical, or to a sublime realm? And if related to the human, should it be sensual, or smart, or witty? Does it have a gender? Or does it belong to the dominion of a particular gender? To what extent is it relative and needs its own context to shine out.These are many of the questions addressed by Eco as they were formulated by thinkers, and it is his anthology of texts, from Theognis and Plato to critics from the 1950s, going through Plotinus, Suger, Hildegard von Bingen, Dante, Alberti, Graci\u00e1n, Hume, Kant, Goethe, Diderot, Baudelaire, Foscolo, Burke, Wilde, Pater, Duchamp amongst very many others, that form the backbone of this book. The copious and beautiful images are unconnected illustrations. They are not addressed by Eco nor specifically related to the selected texts. They form a background musing, colouring the excerpts, like in my review. For the book is conceived as an intellectual exercise, an examination of concepts. It is a theoretical flower then, even if the images add a veneer by appealing to a seen and experienced Beauty. Reading the compendium of excerpts, however, is somewhat unsatisfying and one feels that in this Temple one is just looking at the spine of the books stored in those inviting chambers. But they serve as indications for a later trip, without commentator, when one can stay in one of those rooms and think, not contemplate, some of those notions. And as map of the Search of Beauty this book is excellent.",
            "Pentru c\u0103 am recenzat acum dou\u0103 zile cartea lui David Konstan, Beauty: The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea (2014), am recitit \u0219i Umberto Eco Istoria frumuse\u021bii. Astfel de c\u0103r\u021bi cu multe poze (unele c\u00eet \u00eentreaga pagin\u0103) s\u00eent reconfortante dintr-un motiv simplu: \u00ee\u021bi dau iluzia fericit\u0103 c\u0103 po\u021bi citi 200 de pagini pe or\u0103 sau chiar mai mult, dac\u0103 prive\u0219ti doar o secund\u0103 reproducerile, ceea ce constituie, oricum, un p\u0103cat capital.Niciodat\u0103 nu am v\u0103zut \u00een cartea lui Eco altceva dec\u00eet un album de art\u0103, \u00eenso\u021bit de o antologie de extrase din diver\u0219i autori (antici, medievali, moderni) privitoare la frumos, unele potrivite \u0219i la obiect, altele mai pu\u021bin. Este, a\u0219adar, un album-album \u0219i ceva de genul c\u0103r\u021bilor numite odinioar\u0103 \u201ecommonplacebook\u201d. Deci, nu mi-am f\u0103cut iluzii, nu m-am g\u00eendit deloc la un tratat academic, riguros, cu subsoluri ticsite \u0219i bibliografie exhaustiv\u0103. Nu era cazul s\u0103 m\u0103 formalizez \u0219i nu m-am... Lucrarea con\u021bine tip\u0103rite cu litere mici fragmente din Platon, Boethius, Thoma de Aquino, Hugo de Saint-Victor, Bernard de Clairvaux, Daniel Defoe, Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant etc.Unii cronicari au remarcat inadecvarea titlului. Pentru o \u201eistorie a frumuse\u021bii\u201d e prea pu\u021bin \u0219i prea dispersat. Comentariul lui Eco e, de fapt, un eseu cu muuuuuulte divaga\u021bii, dup\u0103 metoda s\u0103riturii calului la \u0219ah. \u00centr-un capitol vorbe\u0219te despre ve\u0219minte \u0219i culori, \u00een altul despre str\u0103lucire \u0219i lumin\u0103, \u00een al cincilea despre \u201efrumuse\u021bea mon\u0219trilor\u201d, altul se refer\u0103 la frumuse\u021bea femeii, la iubire (cea c\u00eentat\u0103 de trubaduri, numit\u0103 \u201efin' amors) \u0219i la me\u0219te\u0219ugul desuet de a seduce o domni\u021b\u0103 \u00eend\u0103r\u0103tnic\u0103 (\u201eDe la p\u0103stori\u021b\u0103 la femeia-\u00eenger\u201d). Al\u021bii au considerat cartea de-a dreptul lugubr\u0103 (i-au dat o stelu\u021b\u0103 am\u0103r\u00eet\u0103) pentru motivul cuvios c\u0103 are un pre\u021b exagerat. Pe Libris",
            "Really a 3 1/2 star book, but since that's not an option...This book is misnamed, really dictionary of Beauty would be a closer title",
            "Even if I agree with most of the reproaches this book received (that it is more a guide than a study, that it is more a triumph of compression than of clarity, that it is too eclectic and so on) I have to say I really enjoyed it.Is this a consequence of my great admiration for Umberto Eco or of my art dilettantism , I'm not sure (and I won't dig, so back off!). Anyway, I think the author completed his objectives, enumerated in Introduction:- to identify Beauty as a thing worth to be contemplated independently of the desire we may feel for it; -to establish the relationship between Beauty and Art (since Beauty was sometimes perceived simply as a quality of Nature);- to document the history of Beauty (only in Western culture, though) through art (because only the artists left examples) but not to write a history of art.Based on a reviewing of the great artistic movements (whose ideologies influenced - evidently- the conception of Beauty), the essay presents different Aesthetic Ideals from ancient Greece to nowadays, emphasizing the growing complexity of the concept of Beauty, from the antithesis Apollonian - Dionysiac as a very interesting antithesis between vision and sound, to the contemporary syncretism, from Pythagoras' abstract numbers and music of spheres to the prosaic industrialization, from Pericles' ideal of harmony, order, measure, and simplicity, to the orgy of tolerance",
            "This is more source-book than analytical history and while there's no doubting Eco's erudition, all that's really on display here is his ability to summarise and compress vast swathes of literature into a handful of paragraphs : {whisper} this is pretty shallow and superficial, and anyone with an informed view of intellectual history won't learn anything new. What is valuable is the way Eco has effectively curated texts, both visual and literary, and the surprising beauty category tables at the front that throw up unpredictable groupings and interconnections. There's surprisingly little actual commentary from Eco: instead he assumes the artworks and extracts will speak for themselves, even though connections between image and text is often arbitrary. That said, as a compendium of texts related to aesthetics, even if only extracts, this can't help but be useful. It would have been nice to have had more Eco - and the illustrations are lavish and gorgeous. An enhanced coffee-table book I'd say.",
            "Pfff.... That was one hell of a essay. This little gem kept me alive through some tough stuff... (G, I sound clich\u00e9)",
            "It's an interesting topic: what is beauty? It might seem like a trivial question, but think about it: esthetics run through everything we do. Everything we read, watch, listen to, right down to the houses we live in, the cars we drive, the cans we buy food in are made to correspond to some standard of beauty. Where does all that come from? What makes us think a Rolls looks better than a Datsun? What makes Dickens a better writer than Stephenie Meyer? Why did medieaval Christ figures look triumphant and baroque ones suffering? Why is Kate Moss a supermodel and Roseanne Barr not? Can something tragic be beautiful?If you've read Eco before you know he's good at picking up patterns, memes, ideas and how they mutate with time and context. So this is Eco the non-fiction writer tracing society's concept of beauty from pre-historic time to the 21st century, richly illustrated with artworks and architecture and quotes from poets, philosophers and novelists ranging from Plato to Wilde. Venus of Willendorf and Naomi Campbell, Apollo and George Clooney, Warhol and Tizian, Thomas Aquinus and Kafka, they're all in here. Inevitably, even at 400 pages, it becomes a bit of a coffee table book; it's a huge topic, and he doesn't really have time to cover everything (plus, it's all pretty Eurocentric, of course). But being Eco, what he does cover is covered in-depth, giving you a great understanding of how and why standards change and how they relate to changes in the world - the relationships between religion and art, between revolution and poetry, technology and design. Rather brilliant.Plus, obviously, the book itself is beautiful.Now I'm even more intrigued by the sequel On Ugliness; Eco has said that after writing the first book, he realised he'd been writing about standards, about conformity. What about the things that don't conform to the traditional standards? That's another doorstopper.",
            "It's not really a book you read cover to cover, and I guess some of the disappointment many people may feel comes from them picking it up and reading it like that. It is a dictionary a reference, it should open people's mind up to further investigate and research. As someone said the book does reflect his personal opinions and musings, but just by flicking though the book many times I have found myself diving deeper into periods, artists, works of art, techniques etc. "

But, as Diane Purkiss shows, they have far more wicked origins as troublemakers, child snatchers, seducers, and changelings, representing\u00a0society's deepest fears and desires regarding birth, sex, and death. From these dangerous beings of ancient myths and medieval folklore to the sanitized \"wingy thingies\" of Shakespeare and the Victorians, and even modern myths of alien abduction, this is a\u00a0riveting\u00a0chronicle of\u00a0the need to believe in fairies.",

            "Purportedly a history of fairy tales, this book serves neither as a history nor a particularly good resource about legends. I had to give up on this after this passage,In later stories",
            "(this is snipped from the comment I sent to the author Tad Williams about this book on Facebook - I had asked if he'd read it, he said he did not. I asked if he wanted to know what I thought about it and he said sure; here is what follows) I'm first going to say that I am glad I held my reserve. Unfortunately while a lot of what she aims for is some really good and new thinking, she doesn't go as deep into the evidence for her theories as I'd like. She is a lazy scholar and will ramble on about references without context and then just stick a footnote at the end. While I understand this can be common practice, it tends to be common practice amongst the less rigorous. She starts strong - the introduction is fantastic. I was so excited reading it because I thought she'd create a better case for it all -- the case being that Fairies are dangerous truly and not what they've become. It really does start out well, she aligns them with Greek stories of Lamia, Lamashta and Medea. This actually makes a lot of sense but I'm afraid that her thinking, while interesting, doesn't have enough imagination. She basically follows the idea that everything of interest comes OUT of Greece and classical civilization in the Mediterranean. And while she flat out explains that the ancient British and Northern Europeans did indeed have plenty of contact with this world -- it seems beyond her scope to perhaps believe that the stories went BOTH ways. In her mind",

What are fairies really, but the dead, the ancestor, the nameless thing we all fear in the dark. The Other.I absolutely adore this book. It changed my life. That's a great book.",
            "Having spent several years of my life entrenched in academia, I feel a great joy when I find an intelligent, in-depth book that is beautifully readable. This book is so easy to read that a non-specialist can not only understand it, but be interested in it. It was a pleasure to read and I look forward to re-reading it.",
            "It started out so well, but started to drag later on in the book. ",
            "The perception exists with some who attend my storytelling workshops that fairies are always tiny, female and mostly nice. I doubt that many storytellers would hold to this view. We have all heard and sometimes tell stories of baby stealing and other nasty activities of the fairy folk.Diane Purkiss goes further with her study of fairy lore and literature. She sees the roots of fairies in some of the horrific characters of Greek and Roman myths. They didn\u2019t call them fairies in those days but Purkiss points out the similarities shared by gorgons, Lamia, nymphs and Celtic fairies. She says:Fairies come from outside, from outside the community, civilisation, even when they seem to share its values.Fairies were either once people or are like people who have become trapped at a certain indeterminate phase of life.Fairies have links with the dead, and some are the dead.Young men, women in childbirth, and babies and children are particularly vulnerable to fairies.Fairies are compelled to repeat their own circumstances in the lives of others; if they die prematurely, they cause the premature deaths of others; if they are trapped in eternal, storyless youth, they try to trap others in it too.Fairies have bodies which reflect their anomalousness, subtly or directly.Fairies are also particularised to the local situation, as the changing role of nymphs indicates.Fairies are common to peasant cultures, cultures where the centre of life is the village and the space around it.Why do fairies arise in the culture of diverse societies? Purkiss offers three possible explanations:Firstly, common humanity: these are universal cultural archetypes produced by common psychic pressures in every culture.Secondly, common structures: in societies with similar social structures, similar social solutions will be produced; so, for instance, all village societies will produce taciturnity as a norm, and will therefore develop a corpus of folk-beliefs about the disastrous results of loquacity.Thirdly, direct transmission: the Celts learned these stories from their contacts with the Mediterranean peoples, just as the Mediterranean peoples learned these stories from each other.The first explanation is questioned by Purkiss on the grounds that if it were so we would still all look to fairies as an explanation for the unexplainable. While I am sure some do, in the modern world most don\u2019t.Purkiss acknowledges some credibility in the second explanation but expresses a preference for the third:... the ceaseless reshaping of old stories to fit new contexts. Sometimes this involves simple changes of geography, sometimes changes in point of view, sometimes more drastic changes in narrative. But in every case, the result is a blend of continuity and change.But she goes on to say that she doesn\u2019t really know. \u2018As with all else in fairyland, this theory may be a glittering deception.\u2019While some good fairies existed in folklore they were not common. They belong more to literary tales and were perhaps popularised by Shakespeare. Still, Shakespeare\u2019s fairies were often male and not necessarily small. The sweet female fairies came into their own in literature and on the stage of Victorian times and developed into the popular fairies of today mostly in the twentieth century.The design of this book leaves a little to be desired. There is no longer a reason with modern technology to print illustrations in a section separate from the text. To present the illustrations next to the relevant part of the text would not turn this academic tome into a coffee table book. It would merely have made it easier for the reader to refer to them.Many storytellers will consider this a welcome addition to their libraries. It\u2019s main shortcoming is perhaps its strong bias to Europe. Fairy-like creatures from other cultures are barely touched on.\u00a9 copyright John Shield.

            "Hi-yi-yi-yi! Come",
            "This book was a little bit on the odd side, and I had mixed feelings about it. The main character, Glory, is an actress in a TV show similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Mages from another world have been traveling to different worlds in a fruitless search for a hero to help save their people. Finally in desperation, they turn toward Earth and learn about Glory's TV show. They don\u2019t realize she isn\u2019t a real hero, and they ask her to help them. She doesn\u2019t intend to, and she tries to explain the mix-up to them, but things happen, and she ends up getting caught up in events in spite of herself.I thought the story started off with a really corny feel, like it was written more for fun than to be taken seriously. For the first 25% or so of the book, I really didn\u2019t much care for it. My most burning question during the first part of the book was, why was one of Glory\u2019s props on the show a real (if not very sharp) sword? And of course she just happened to have it on her when she ends up in this other world. My second question was, why does Glory carry a stuffed elephant everywhere she goes? I also got a little exasperated with her constantly taking off and putting on her costume and her makeup (which she just happened to have on hand also!) so that she would look and feel more like her character. The people she was there to save also annoyed me at first because they were so helpless and so unwilling to stand up for themselves or do anything proactive.Something happened somewhere around the 25% mark. I don\u2019t know if I became numb to the corniness of it all, or if it became more subtle, or if the story itself simply caught my attention so well that I forgot to be bothered by how corny it was. But I suddenly couldn\u2019t put the book down, and I didn\u2019t want to. I somehow got caught up in the story, I started to like the characters, and I started to care about what happened. There were some interesting reveals about just what had taken place in the world Glory was trying to help, and some interesting moral dilemmas. The book may have started out silly, but it seemed to take on some more depth as things progressed. I found myself both happy and sad about the way things were resolved.The ending wasn\u2019t abrupt, exactly. All the main events were tied up and we were given an idea of what the future held for the characters. But I wanted to see a little bit of that future. A prologue taking place a year later would have been nice \u2013 something to give me more information about how everybody\u2019s lives progressed as a result of the events and decisions made at the end of the book.I had trouble figuring out how to rate this book. By the end, I was tempted to give it four stars. But I can\u2019t forget the first 25% that I didn\u2019t think was very good. Then there was the slightly unsatisfied feeling I had at the end of the book, and the fact that some of the things that annoyed me in the beginning (such as the stuffed animal being carried everywhere and the costume and makeup) persisted all the way through the book and provided twinges of annoyance periodically. So I decided four stars was too generous, but I would give it three and a half if I could.",
            "At this point, there's a long tradition of Earth person with an esoteric career gets magically transported to a fantasy realm requiring exactly their skills. Fortunately",
            "The Warslayer is a tongue-in-cheek, self-aware fantasy version of the movie Galaxy Quest. Our heroine is Glory McArdle, former Olympic athlete and gym teacher turned TV serial actress who portrays Vixen the Slayer, a red-headed Amazon type persona that's a cross between Red Sonja and Xena. As those who have watched the aforementioned movie can deduce, our protagonist becomes mistaken for the character she plays and is transported by an alien species to their homeworld via magical teleportation. All of a sudden she is the sole hope for the survival of this peaceful people.I had no real expectations coming into this novel, other than the title and cover art lowering the bar a little. I was actually pleasantly surprised. The story was entertaining and amusing, chock full of pop culture references as the heroine realizes just how ridiculous the entire scenario is. She grows from being the bad television actress she was into the heroine needed. It was bit slow at first and parts of the plot were disjointed, but overall it's a silly yet fun fantasy lark that doesn't take itself seriously.",
            "This is essentially Buffy the Vampire Slayer + Xena: Warrior Princess + Galaxy Quest, all of which both the story and its protagonist - former gymnast turned TV action heroine Gloria McArdle - are fully aware. It's not a new story, but it's a pretty enjoyable variant, and more serious than the premise might imply.",
            "Been meaning to read this book for some time now - shouldn't have waited so long.I know the plot is an old one - TV star gets transported and has to save the world... but Glory/Vixen/slayer is such a relatable character that you just gotta love her. Bit like a Xena in training. Dialog is a bit Australian but that just adds to the appeal.Warmly recommended",
            "This has been one of my favorites since the first time I read it. I honestly wish she'd write a sequel or something more.",
            "What a fun, cleverly written story. I was originally wary about the plot premise but found well written characters and a very satisfying ending. I hope to read more by this author.",

I've always had mixed feelings about this author and this book was no exception. The idea was a good one and I did enjoy it, but I felt as if she was trying too hard at times. Still, can't beat the price.",
            "While this novel starts off really making fun of Xena, the meat of it is actually a rather serious fantasy story. Glory, AKA Vixen, as an actress for The Incredibly True Adventures of Vixen the Slayer and while waiting to do a special for MTV she is aproached by three people that claim to be mages that seek her help in saving their people and world. As cheesy as this plot may sound it is quite a fun story and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I was expecting this to have more comedy elements to it, but was not in the least bit disapointed with the story despite the seriousness.",
            "This was both a fun book, and a tongue in cheek.I especially liked the ending, but you can only really appreciate the characters thinking by having followed her growth as a character, and surprises that are at the heart of the story. I believe I readthis long ago, too, but it was all the better to come upon it anew. It is one I want to look back on, & I will be reading it again....",

            "Back in high school, my teacher listed the step-by-step plot development of Guy de Maupassant\u2019s The Necklace, telling us this was a perfectly constructed short-story.For years I have been looking for comparable perfection in a short-story. I found it! Maxim Gorky\u2019s Twenty-Six Men and a Girl is simply breathtaking. As I reread over and over again I can almost not believe my eyes. Such stark social realism combined with the mythic, how art and beauty and love are at the very core of infusing our lives with depth and meaning; particularly love, just how much we as humans love one another, and how we hold on and sacrifice for love\u2019s tender beauty.The story begins: \u201cThere were six-and-twenty of us--six-and-twenty living machines in a damp, underground cellar, where from morning till night we kneaded dough and rolled it into kringels. Opposite the underground window of our cellar was a bricked area, green and moldy with moisture. The window was protected from outside with a close iron grating, and the light of the sun could not pierce through the window panes, covered as they were with flour dust.\u201dMaxim Gorky grew up an orphan and was sent out by his grandfather to work at the age of eight, such jobs as errand-boy, dishwasher, icon painter, kitchen help. Frequently beaten by his employers, nearly always hungry and ill clothed, as a teenager Gorky hit the road to live the life of a tramp. Reading over the details of his hardscrabble life, it strikes me Gorky the lowlife tramp wanted to write as much as a drowning man wants air. Thank goodness he succeeded!Back to the story. The narrator tells us how music was a large part of men\u2019s lives in the cellar, \u201cThen, all six-and-twenty of us would be singing; our loud, harmonious song would fill the whole cellar, our voices would travel outside and beyond, striking, as it were, against the walls in moaning sobs and sighs, moving our hearts with soft, tantalizing ache, tearing open old wounds, and awakening longings.\u201d So, so telling. When all appears to be dank and dismal, sublime music to the rescue.And, then, alas, we read how there is a ray of beauty in their lives come from the outside world, \u201cTanya, a little maid-servant of sixteen. Every morning there peeped in through the glass door a rosy little face, with merry blue eyes; while a ringing, tender voice called out to us: Little prisoners! Have you any knugels",
            "Oh! Those Russians! They were literary giants, even when writing in the short story format.And I still have so much of their terrible landscapes (geographical and spiritual) to explore.I confess I was a blank page when it comes to Maxim Gorky, and I am now a fan after only a few pages of this more bitter (that's how you translate 'gorki', a pseudonim, from Russian) than sweet fairytale. Associating fables with socialist realism might sound counterintuitive, but this is exactly how I feel about the present story. The title itself suggested an over-ambitious Snow White kind of princess who thinks seven adoring dwarves are not nearly enough for her ego. The opening lines reinforce my original idea :  There were six-and-twenty of us -- six-and-twenty living machines in a damp, underground cellar, where from morning till night we kneaded dough and rolled it into kringels. [Side note : these kringels or 'covrigi calzi' are still extremely popular in Romania, and if you are lucky you can still find places where they are baked right in front of you: the dough hand twisted, boiled in big vats and then flipped on long wooden paddles into those big ovens whose mouths open like the gate to hell (the image taken directly from Gorky's story.]Ugly, diseased, uncouth, untalented - these men are literally at the bottom of the social ladder, little better than slaves, their wits dulled by repetitive labour, their horizon limited by the walls of their cellar where even the high windows are covered with grime and permanently closed by iron grates to prevent strangers from coming and begging for free samples. Yet such a visitor makes a habit of sneaking in every morning, descending from one of the upper floors where seamstresses work with gold thread and brocades, for an apron full of the hot pretzels. Fifteen year old Tanya - pretty, perky, blonde, with a smile and a kind word for eveyone - becomes the sole ray of sunshine in the 'dwarves' bleak existence. She is praised, cherished and adored like one of those holy icons with a golden halo you can spot in all Orthodox churches. No harsh words, not even one dirty thought is allowed to be associated with the sunny Tanya. There's nothing they wouldn't do for their beautiful angel. Painful and terrible it is when a man goes on living, while nothing changes around him; and when such an existence does not finally kill his soul, then the monotony becomes with time, even more and more painful. And still, in this eternal battle between light and darkness, why do we still find it so hard to abandon our baser instincts? Why do we need to scratch at the glittering surface, trying to find fault in beauty and to bring idols down to our own level of envy and mistrust?  Sometimes a man's life is so poor, that he is driven instinctively to prize his vice and to live by it; one may say for a fact that often men are vicious from boredom. The bakery men will put Tanya to a test, to see for sure whether she is made of gold or tinsel. It will not be her faults that are revealed but their own greed and pettiness. Gorky's harsh, bitter assessment of human nature has lost none of its poignancy in the hundred-plus years since he first put it down on paper. The parting words of Tanya (  Ah",
            "Absolutely amazing !!. One of the best short story collections I've ever read in my life. Maxim Gorky's tales are so vivid and full of life. Each of these stories tells us a great deal about how much these people have suffered to earn a living, coz most of his characters represents the working class of Russia. ",
            "An exceptional short story on social realism and lost ideals. This is Maxim Gorky's most famous short story and reveals the interplay of collective frustrations about social iniquity against the prejudices of that era and how these men too become victims of a similar kind of prejudice, when faced with a similar scenario.",
            "Maxim Gorky is one of the finest authors of Russian Literature. His books are psychological portrayal of his contemporaries, especially of those hailing from the lower strata of the Russian people. He is the best when he tries to understand and write about the tales and travails of the laity belonging to the lower rung of society, the peasants, the labourers and the workers. He has an eye for detail as well as for the plight of the poor. All stories in this book are great, but the 26-men story gets itched in your memory, never to leave your mind and heart. The story is a poignant reminder of the workers, busy like bees in the bakery, where the sight of a girl is a silver lining in the cloud, even as she gets attracted towards a rich army officer, who misleads and tempts her, and all the hopes of the working men, for whom she is an epitome, not only of hope and beauty, but also of wisdom, get shattered. The story ends on a 'real' note!",
            "Three short stories in which Gorky explores the personal conflicts of workers, laborers, fishermen, and tramps. In his hands, the work, living conditions, and struggles are real. Each story deals with how individuals deal with temptations. Sometimes the main character does the right thing, or, as in the title story, what is dished out comes back.",

            "Criminal Justice by Barbara Parker is set in 1990s Miami. Dan Galindo used to be a successful federal prosecutor. He used to be happily married. He used to live in a luxury home and belong to an exclusive country club. Now his ex-wife lives in luxury, while he lives in a tiny apartment and works out of a has-been defense attorney\u2019s office in a seedy part of town. He has limited visitation rights with his son. He has a spoiled-brat girlfriend who plays in a hoping-to-be-discovered rock band. Dan\u2019s downfall came when he refused to put a key witness on the stand, because he knew the witness lied. He followed his conscience. But when the feds lost the case, Dan was fired. None of the hotshot Miami legal firms wanted a failure. Lacking work and self-confidence, he drank away his marriage.Dan lost everything important in his life except his integrity, which makes him a sympathetic hero in this story, surrounded by criminals and biased law enforcement. But Dan has an unrealistic fantasy of taking his son on an international fishing trip\u2026and takes dangerous risks to achieve it.Federal prosecutor Elaine McHale respected Dan for his integrity when they worked together. She\u2019s on a money-laundering case with the DEA. Dan enters their radar by representing a rock musician as a favor to a friend. The DEA suspect the rock band is a front for criminal activity, assume Dan is fully aware and participating in the crimes, since Dan is seen regularly with the criminals. The DEA doesn\u2019t know (nor would they believe) Dan is just doing a favor so he can borrow an exotic speedboat.Dan\u2019s friend is holding back secrets. He is badly in debt with his recording studio, suspects his major backer is \u201cdirty\u201d, but must keep working for a \u201cbreak\u201d with the band. The money-laundering kingpin is a sexually attractive man who is brutal and amoral. People under his control do not get away alive. When Dan\u2019s girlfriend is viciously murdered in Dan\u2019s apartment, after leaving a recorded message that she was going to tell him something important, the police are so certain Dan committed the crime, they don\u2019t investigate the murder. Dan must track down the killer himself. His efforts link him further to the federal investigation and the criminal kingpin.Suspense mounts as the feds set a trap for the kingpin, more deaths occur, the rock band desperately tries to produce a demo record, and Dan struggles to fix his life. Betrayals abound. A fast-paced thriller with interconnecting plot threads, \u201crecommended for mature audiences\u201d due to violence. Overall, it\u2019s a fairly dark and depressing depiction of Miami\u2019s underbelly, with only Dan and Elaine shining through.",
            "In the first pages of the book are short phrases of reviews on this title as well as on other titles by Barbara Parker. For Criminal Justice, the Key West Citizen said, Realistic dialogue",
            "This. Book is filled with unexpected turns. I really liked the protagonist. He is far from perfect but at his core he's a really good guy. The author has a real feel for Miami and the south Florida lifestyle. I'm a great fan of Barbara Parker. It's too bad she didn't write more. ",
            "Dan Galindo, a disgraced former prosecutor, is working out of a small firm. His client, also a friend, leads him into a web of drug lords, DEA, federal attorneys, and a rock band. The characters were interesting, but there were so many of them and the plot was so complicated, I occasionally got lost with who was who and who was doing what. The action was well written. Overall, the book was enjoyable and I'll read more in the series.",
            "Good who dunnitset in the music recording industry.Lots of information on how a recording is actually made using sophisticated equipment and moody musicians. Good mystery to sit by the pool and read; nothing to make your heart race.",
            "It's really a 3 1/2. An okay book.",
            "Ok book. I probably should have read the backing better. I was waiting for a court thriller",
            "The first book I read By this author. Sorry it took so long I let this when it caught in the rain out by the pool. Had to let it dry out before I could read it. I enjoyed the book enjoyed the characters. They call this a romantic mystery or thriller but it kept things moving along and didn't spend too much time on the romantic side. I have to say enjoyed the book I would've given it three stars but I'm giving it four stars because I'm optimistic that the next when I read be just as good and they both will serve four stars."

At first is a little bit ponderous. Many people may leave it in the first 1/4 or 1/3; but once you pass through that barrier and you're inside",
            "Super cool concept, very good book.",
            "Amazing novel that ranks as one of the most enjoyable time travel novels I have ever read. The idea of traveling back through time by inhabiting the bodies of ancestors was fun. ",
            "There's the core of a good idea and a good potboiler of a sci-fi time travel novel here, but it gets bogged down in awkward sex scenes and a shallow recreation of Napoleonic-era politics. (Didn't help that I read this directly after a Patrick O'Brian novel.) There's also at least one maddening loose end: David clearly realises his psych patient from the start of the book is a fellow time skipper, and I presumed this was where he'd eventually find Silv in the final act, but instead she just... never gets mentioned again? Where did she come from?",
            "This is a classic in science fiction, but not a super well known book due to, as I understand it, estate issues and only one or two editions. It is, however, the number one recommended book in my entire family, because it has an impact on how you think about the power of the mind, and what it means to travel and explore your own limitations. It's the number one book I look for in used book stores, because I've given away my last copy so many times I can never remember if I have a copy for myself to re-read, and I never seem to get it back from others.The magic of this book is not just in the time travel which is so very well done, but also in the psychological growth that all of the characters go through from the beginning of the book to the end, and how it parallels the actual story line, regardless of where the time travel is occurring depending on the individual's time lines, (because, like any good time travel, everyone's chronological time and personal time varies, so characters are meeting at different times. This is important, and plays a huge part when you go back and re-read it the second or third time, and begin to see the underlayment of the story.)To be honest, I never actually think of this book as being science fiction, I think of it as being a book about personal growth, the difference between what our past dictates we become, (on both a personal and a world-view level,) and how much our actions actually do matter, (there's that time travel again.)That being said, don't bother with McQuay's other books. Seriously.",
            "This book did not hold my attention at all. First of all, I did not like the main character. The storyline was not compelling and did not generate any interest for me. I stopped reading it at about 1/4 of the way through."

            "Wonderful book! My son picked this out on his own for one of his level 2 reading books, and I even think it's closer to a level 3 but we both really enjoyed it! We're having issues with mosquitoes lately since we've had flooding here in NE Ohio, and so the mosquito population has tripled this summer. My poor dogs get surrounded instantly the second they go outside. It's miserable. This book talks about how to be careful not to disturb bats in caves and how they can eat 300 mosquitoes in 15 minutes. On top of that, they have plans in the back of the book on how to build your own bat house and a group kids can join to help people be more aware of bats and that they're not scary. I absolutely hate bugs but never had an issue with bats. Now with the recent bug problem, I'm insisting my husband make me some bat houses this week, and my 5 yr old is going to help him. A science lesson and reading lesson in one!",
            "This book is very informative and is aimed to educate elementary school children about bats.There was a strong influence on the ways that humans can accidentally cause bats to die in this book and my 9 year old nephew was a little sensitive to these facts (although his 8 year old sister wasn't), but, overall, it's essential for kids to know how our inadvertent actions can affect these animals.This book also touched on what to do if a bat flies into one's house. This isn't a common problem where I live, but it's very good information to have stored just in case.Overall, the kids enjoyed learning about what and how much bats eat, how bats find their way around, and the roles of bats in relation to humans. I found this book perfect for the kids' age group and that the book gave enough information for me, as the reader, to answer any of the kid's extra questions.",

John Cornwell nos narra, adem\u00e1s de un per\u00edodo trascendental de la historia contempor\u00e1nea, la actividad de los cient\u00edficos alemanes, desde el ascenso de Hitler al poder en 1933 hasta su derrota en 1945. Con ello nos permite conocer el comportamiento de los investigadores en el campo de las especialidades cient\u00edficas en las que Alemania sobresali\u00f3 hasta colocarse a la cabeza del mundo. Algunos de esos investigadores eran nazis convencidos y entusiastas, pero muchos otros fueron simples compa\u00f1eros de viaje. Algunos, pocos, opusieron resistencia o se rebelaron contra el r\u00e9gimen y sus esfuerzos hicieron que el conflicto se prolongara. La incapacidad de traducir tecnolog\u00eda punta en logros militares es una caracter\u00edstica esencial de la historia universal, mientras que la denigrante explotaci\u00f3n de las v\u00edctimas de los campos de la muerte y de una mano de obra en r\u00e9gimen de esclavitud constituye una deshonra para la comunidad cient\u00edfica que trabaj\u00f3 al servicio del Tercer Reich. Pero, en realidad, el inquietante libro de Cornwell formula preguntas acerca del comportamiento de los cient\u00edficos en general, sin distinci\u00f3n de nacionalidad ni ideolog\u00eda, y ampl\u00eda su perspectiva hasta la Guerra Fr\u00eda y la lucha contra el terrorismo.",

I have seen it said Hitler was a veg, and I have also seen it that he ate pheasant. Therefore, he was not a vegetarian. Regardless of whether he was, the author presents Hitler as an ignoramus who thought he knew all about science but did not -- and this does not seem farfetched to me -- but the section at the beginning where Cornwell is sort of listing Hitler's foibles, proving",
            "It is sad when authors try to give us new history. For instance Albert Speer was never a member of the NAZI-party. You only have to read Speer's Inside the Third Reich. At N\u00fcrnberg he was found not guilty on the charge of belonging to the NAZI-party.So why the author mentions briefly that Speer was a member is totally the opposite to what history teaches us.Just had to get that off my chest.",
            "This book was a wake up call, I never realized that a writer could try and rewrite history and promote a narrative of hatred and negative propaganda of the worst kind. I read this book twice just to make sure it was not a alternative universe with alternative facts. There are so many assumptions and misunderstandings that it read like a fairy tale written to misinform and mislead the reader into thinking that the German people were incompetent. I don't think John Cornwell did much research into any facts about German Science, he believes Einstein was some sort of Genius and his theories are correct, which has been shown him to be a plagiarist and liar, with relativity now in the dust bin, many try to keep scientism alive though. Darwin has also been debunked, regardless of what the liberal universities keep preaching.The National Socialists created the outline for all the real sciences for the next 80 years, by the weeding out of theory before fact approach which achieved nothing prior to the clear minded and practical Germanic genius. Industry and invention owes so much to this period in history from the National Socialist approach",
            "Good stuff.The author probes the idea of healing in the Nazi regime. This is not the typical book relating the ghastly deeds of of Hitler's Scientists, although there is a bit of that to be sure. However, the focus is on figuring out how doctors and scientists went completely counter to their roles and duties as public servants - to do no harm.He tackles how these forces actually changed attitudes, not that the doctors were simply following orders, but their intrinsic belief in what they were doing.",
            "An abridged audio cd by the author of Hitler's Pope. Filled with some interesting stories and some that are so horrible they take a huge step to understand how human beings can be so monstrous to each other. I think it also shows the dangers of scientific ignorance. There were some fun stories mixed in. My favorite is about Niels Bohr. He was explaining a mathematical formula when he said And and then became silent for several moments. Then he said So and continued out loud further down the line with what he was saying. I think I will try that some day. ",
            "At 535 pages I feel I deserve a purple heart for the effort. English authors tend to be verbose and long winded and this one is no exception. So I found mysellf reading the same thoughts and ideas more than once. But on the plus side, and there were many, my learning curve on the amazing scientifical and technological advances that can happen during a war lept off the page.  It's almost as if those with the more technically advanced weapons won the war. at least it was with this war. While their war machines and skills were ahead of us at the beginning we soon caught and surpassed them. Or war plane tech surpassed theirs, or sonar caught their subs, or radar spotted their planes, or intelligence cracked their codes, or tanks finally equalled theirs and ultimately or a-bombs were built before they could build one. And surprisingly it appears that one of the greatest scientist living at the time ( right behind Einstein) Heisenberg, the German scientist, purposely and subtlety made sure that his own German army wouldn't create an atomic bomb. He knew how evil his own government had become. Rockets, jet engines, splitting of the atom and much more propelled this world of ours into new and uncharted territories. This book documents it's beginnings.",
            "Audiobook listener here. I thought the story here was rather interesting. As someone who\u2019s always been fascinated by the Indiana Jones vs Nazi Germany trope (for real though, I have always wanted to know if Hitler really was as obsessed with the occult as those movies make him out to be), I was excited by the prospect of a book that looks into science as it was before, during, and after the Third Reich. While the book is far, far more grounded than I secretly hoped it would be, I still found it quite enjoyable. I do have to admit that the narration of the book is rather dry, but even so, I gladly found myself listening right to the end. I\u2019d say that has more to do with my interest in the subject than the narrator\u2019s talents, but if niche history is your thing, I think you\u2019ll get through it just fine too. ",
            "This book gives a decent account of how Hitler and the Nazis used and misused their scientists leading up to and during WWII. From driving out Jews, including Einstein and similar, to initially drafting many of the German scientists into the Wermacht as common soldiers, there wasn't really a solid plan to use their talents. Even work on atomic weapons was nothing like the Manhattan Project in the US. Hitler seemed to prefer to focus on his V-1 and V-2 rocket programs to attack and destroy London. This drained some support for the Jet aircraft programs so that they were too little and too late. After the war there was a scramble by the allies to round up the Nazi scientists to use them for weapons programs and more as the world entered the Cold War. Overall this was an interesting read and worth the time if you are interested in WWII and related topics.",
            "Informative, technical, kind of dry. This book gives a comprehensive view of the history of science in Germany for the first half of the 20th century. Some parts are definitely informative and others are dry and hard to get through.However, the book\u2019s most important section might be the final one, which discusses the importance of science, politics, and ethics. An important read to understand the ethics of science and the role of scientists in the world, but can be dense at times. Give it a read if you science or the history of scientific achievement and it\u2019s impact on the world is of interest to you. ",
            "The majority of this book deals with German science and scientists with at least a quarter of the book covering the period before Hitler rose to power. The author also provides information on non-German science and scientists interspersed throughout the book. He mentions the support given to German science and scientists before WW II and the rehabilitation of many of them after WWII. In the end he raises questions of ethics which good scientists must address.",
            "This was just super dense while also being a little light on what I was hoping for somehow. There were a ton of names in here, and explanations of science and experiments they were working on, but there was also a lot of information about what other scientists thought of Hitler\u2019s scientists and a lot of speculation about what if the Nazis had managed a bomb first. Not exactly what I was expecting, but still not bad. ",

            "Very good view into not only the scientists that worked with Hitler but the ones he let go because of his beliefs about their religious leanings and their ideology.

            "Hitler's ScientistsA terrifying book, if you think of what might have beenJohn Cornwell has produced a book that is at the same time gripping as a detective novel, readable as a John Grisham book, and terrifying like the very best horror stories by H.P. Lovecraft. In this 500 page book is the entire spectrum of Nazi science from basic research to its gruesome applications in the concentration camps, and from utterly useful processes for producing nitrogen fertilizers to the Vergeltungswaffen and their rocket science.Before the Great War, Germany was a leading country in many fields, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and industrial applications thereof. The war left it crippled and struggling to survive in the economic tumult, but enough of its scientists survived the war to start the new armament industries. The German work ethic was applied to rebuilding industries, and as soon as Hitler took over, the Wehrmacht. Cornwell lists literally dozens of key players in this rearmament program, scientists and economists alike. Hitler's dictatorship enabled a wholly new way of working towards the reborn supremacy of Germany, and science stood poised for success. But then Hitler's inane racial laws started to bite: Jews were at first made uncomfortable in the universities and other research facilities, as well as important professions such as medicine. Then they were expeller, and later still, persecuted and ultimately herded off to the concentration camps. This was Hitler's first folly.The second, at least as idiotic, was his megalomaniac and and paranoid way of keeping control of as much as he possibly could. This meant he was shown the results of science and research, and then he decided what would be a good application for any given idea in his plan of world dominance. Hitler is shown to have lacked even the basic scientific understanding, and therefore, many useful ideas and projects were led astray from becoming real tools in his war. The idea of German Science is about as stupid as you can get: leading Aryan scientists declared that any theoretical work",
            " From the outside, everyone looks at the German War Machine of WW2 as awesome, high-tech, efficient, nearly unstoppable, but for the combined volume of Russian soldiers and American equipment. As you study the inside, it is amazing that it did as well as it did in spite of the chaotic, capricious, egotistical, uninformed, self-destructive way it was run. Hitler was truly his own worst enemy, a passionately driven, amateur, a cunning political operative, but a military hack, crippled by the very ideals and concepts that drove him. I have seen this on the military side, and now I see it on the scientific side. Still for all the complex issues and personalities involved, I come time and agin to the simple reason that we had two great European started wars, being that England was jealous, and guarding it's waning power against Germany's growing power. There is an ignored lesson in these great conflicts, that violently trying to maintain your power is only a means to hasten the loss. Even in our politics, we see a party frantically trying to secure it's power, while driving all but one shrinking, though fervent, demographic away from it's future. Those who forget history, ..., are legion.  As I get deeper into the book, it is not an easy read, rather demanding that you be a science or history nerd. yet, it also reads like a Steam Punk novel of demented scientists inventing bizarre technologies to take over the world. You know scientists from mere mentions in history texts, but then you find that they too have messy lives no better than our current crop of crazy politicians. All at the same time it is boring and fascinating, difficult and gossipy, scary but history so maybe it doesn't hurt anymore, only it really does. What these people did, affected a nation, a world, and my father's family, and so me. What happened in europe then, not only generated me, but how i grew up, how I was made to feel about my heritage. The victors write the history, and that is an elemental truth, but eventually they die, and eventually someone looks for the other story. Eventually you learn about how the Carthaginians saw the Punic Wars, not just the Romans. Eventually you know more, if you look to know more. You may not find white to contrast the black that you have been taught, but you almost certainly will find shades of grey.  I see the day to day corruption of a system devoted to truth and knowledge, the tools that took us from primitive conditions as surely as fire and the wheel. It puts me in mind of the corruption done by so called Christian science and science deniers, being political tools masked for legitimacy to confuse the masses, the Cuckoo's egg. This book has enough insight to be worthy of a College course, it is so comprehensive.",
            "Some books don't live up to the promise of the Title, while others, like this one, give more than expected from the title alone. Cornwell discusses many of Germany's leading scientists, some of whom chose to leave their homeland as the Nazi's came to power, others who felt compelled to stay due to their Nationalistic feelings, and others who willingly and knowingly participated in the racist philosophy of the Nazi's. But the book also give a lot of historical context of the era, from WWI up to and through the cold war well after the fall of Germany. There are also numerous parallel stories involving British and American scientific efforts, such as those involving code breaking and atomic weapon developments. And while its easy to condemn any German scientist who supported the Nazi war effort, Cornwell also reminds us that many of those same scientists were subsequently recruited by both Soviet and western governments after the war to work on rocket and weapon research programs for these Cold War opponents. The dilemma raised by the book, for scientists and citizens alike, is recognizing the difference between the necessity of fully supporting your duly elected leaders, and the personal decisions to be made if policies have drifted beyond recognized moral limits as during the Holocaust. ",
            "As I struggled to wrap my (figurative) hands over my twisted and warped ideas about the Nazis and what they did to millions of Jews, I decided that it was time to find out the truth. And so I was thrust down into the pages of a world of tyranny, prejudice, greed, threats, twisted idealisms, and pure pandemonium. As the brilliant minds of the Manhattan Project toiled in the United States, the Nazi scientists of Hitler were embarking on a series of attempts to create the ultimate weapons. Such of these were the V-series of missiles which devastated cities like London through bomb raids. But, the Nazis failed to create a weapon of mass destruction in the final months of the war, and thus lost it.The book itself presents irrefutable evidence and convictions of infamous scientist like Heisenberg, and thus rectifies past mistakes in our understanding of the convoluted conspiracy theories and such surrounding the Nazi science movement",
            "This is an interesting read of a different perspective of the Third Reich, namely that of the Nazi scientists and their activities. The book stretches from World War One to the War on Terror and poses some thoughtful perspectives regarding whether science (knowledge) can be pursued independently of politics, and therefore ultimate responsibility. Some frightening things were done under the Nazi regime and it amazes me that educated and intelligent people condoned and conducted these activities. The book treats many topics, so some of them perhaps could have some more detail but nevertheless the book is broadly comprehensive and more to the point - entertaining. Give it a try if you are interested in either history or science.",
            "This look at science before, during and after WWII in Germany is at once fascinating and frustrating. While I learned a few things I didn't know before, most of the time I found the writing too top-level and distant. The author skims the various topics and doesn't linger long enough on any of them. Overall it felt disjointed and too spotty. The stories were interesting but not well told. It read more like a dry history text-book with no spark or life. I actually recall a history text-book or two from college that were more engaging.",
            "This was an excellent book full of detailed information. I was amazed at the names that later became famous for many varieties of science that were involved with the Third Reich, and also to hear stories of those who stood up to Hitler and his cronies.Each chapter takes on a different aspect of science in Germany from the 1900s through the 1950s, concentrating on their impact during the Second World War.A good half inch of the back of the book is indexing and the foot notes proving the author's case.Interesting and meaty reading.",
            "Not a good book to choose as an audio book because it was very dense and I couldn't easily flip back and look up names or people I had forgotten along the way. It covered a wide range of scientists and sciences during WWI and WWII. Although I definitely didn't get as much out of this book from listening as I would have through reading, I was struck by two things: science shouldn't be done in a moral vacuum, and how important community and communication is to scientific discovery. I might come back to a book like this in the future.",
            "My Remembrance Day tradition is to read a book about the military or military service, including UN missions and accounts of civilians in wartime situations.Hitler's Scientists is a very scary illustration of how scientists can themselves become weapons, and of the power wielded by the Nazi regime over science in Germany and the countries under its control.This book should be required reading for anyone studying or working in any field of science, medicine, bioethics, politics, and philosophy."

His job is uncertain, he\u2019s recovering from the death of his wife and his adoptive son, Sam, is not adjusting well. Jake doesn\u2019t have enough to go around. Trying to be everything to everyone, father and son occasionally exchange harsh words. Feeling ignored, thirteen year old Sam asks dad to find his real mom. When a series of unexpected, dangerous and mysterious events unfold, their bond of love becomes the only link. Jake\u2019s search for truth begins while on assignment. Close to the town where Sam\u2019s adoption took place, he stops by the old office. The investigation turns discouraging when the space is occupied by a travel bureau. Jake inquires about the adoption agency, but no one seems to know anything. When he returns the next day, the travel agency has disappeared!Many miles away, Sam is at home with the housekeeper. Frequently he calls dad for the latest information, but Sam still feels left out. When Jake runs into a dead end, Sam comes up with valuable information off the internet, and then he vanishes. Panicked, Jake blows a vital interview for American Outrage and endangers his job. But when Sam shows up in Jakes motel room, things take a risky turn.Jake has been threatened, chased and shot at. Utilizing past friends and FBI contacts he stubbornly pursues all leads. Fearing the worst, he arranges for Sam to stay with a relative.

Falsified documents, white baby markets and high society cover-ups make the truth difficult to untangle. Who can be trusted? Who has the real answers? Will Sam want to hear them?

            "As host of the TV news show American Outrage the widowed Jake Carlson is an expert at digging up the truth behind the real story. When his teenage adopted son, Sam, asks Jake to track down his birth mother Jake grudgingly agrees. Sam has been acting up in school lately and Jake thinks finding his birth mother might bring Sam some peace. The further Jake digs the more he reveals shocking evidence of crimes including illegal baby trafficking and a long line of cover ups in one of New York's wealthiest political families. Jake and Sam get caught up in a dangerous game with players who will stop at nothing to keep the truth from being revealed. I enjoyed listening to the abridged version of American Outrage and thought it was a great story but just a little too predictable. I saw situations coming from a mile away and even correctly guessed the ending but I still felt that it was worth my time. Jake is endearing as the caring Dad who is trying to do right by his son and Sam is an annoying know-it-all with a potty mouth but Green makes it work within the story line. What I also liked about the story is that when all was said and done",

Selain itu, terdapat juga usaha untuk menghalangnya oleh seorang senator Kongres Amerika Syarikat yang khuatir nama baik keluarganya terjejas sekiranya terbongkar siapakah ibu-bapa Sam yang sebenar.Secara keseluruhannya, masih lagi boleh dianggap menghiburkan untuk dibaca. Terdapat beberapa twist yang tidak dijangka. Jalan dan plot ceritanya juga bersifat fast-paced dan tidak kompleks. Namun demikian, apa yang kurang saya berpuas hati adalah penamatnya yang boleh saya kelaskan sebagai anti-klimaks.",

What Jake soon discovers is an illegal adoption ring that involves a dirty politician. Now everyone Jake holds near and dear to him is in danger including himself. Jake is the type of guy you want fighting on your side. He stands for everything that is right, no matter how terrible the times get. American Outrage is a high-intensity, thrill ride a minute.

Well now that I have read what Mr. Green has to offer, I plan on checking out all of his other works including his next novel, Above the Law. ",

            "Wow, what a let down. I somehow thought this book was going to be a comment on shows that exploit people in crisis. Instead it was nothing but a fairly pedestrian thriller that was a bit laughable. You can practically hear the grinding as the plot wheels turn. Not worth it. Glad it was a library book.",
            "This book was quite excellent! I tried to read it as slowly as possible so that it would not end but we know that everything must come to an end at some time.

            "Fairly good book about a TV interviewer helping his adopted son look for his biological mother. Best part was the juxtaposition of the brainless topics of the interviews (totally typical of current TV interviews) with the strong emotions of the son in hoping to find his mother.",

            "Voltaire's novel introduces the reader to Candide, a wide-eyed, calm and slightly bland young gentleman who resides at Castle Westphalia and who believes in the philosophy that everything in the world is for the best. One of the first scenes is filled with two emotional opposites for Candide who first gets to kiss his love",
            "Slightly disappointed with the next-Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I took on this classic next IN ONE SITTING.&...WOW!Where has this one been all my life? I adore Candide because it is rife with adventure",
            "All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\u2026And following this sententious wisdom Candide embarks on the quest of his life.Never was anything so gallant, so well accoutred, so brilliant, and so finely disposed as the two armies. The trumpets, fifes, hautboys, drums, and cannon made such harmony as never was heard in Hell itself.His adventures begin with war\u2026 Wars bring glory to those who are on the winning side\u2026 Especially to the monarchs and their generals\u2026 As for the rest, they may rest in peace.But Candide never frets\u2026 He moves on\u2026\u201cAll this was indispensably necessary,\u201d replied the one\u2013eyed doctor, \u201cfor private misfortunes are public benefits; so that the more private misfortunes there are, the greater is the general good.\u201dSo Candide never worries\u2026 He moves on\u2026 He bravely proceeds from bad to worse\u2026 And his followers, those who had managed to survive, follow\u2026\u201cThe Moors presently stripped us as bare as ever we were born. My mother, my maids of honor, and myself, were served all in the same manner. It is amazing how quick these gentry are at undressing people. But what surprised me most was, that they made a rude sort of surgical examination of parts of the body which are sacred to the functions of nature. I thought it a very strange kind of ceremony; for thus we are generally apt to judge of things when we have not seen the world. I afterwards learned that it was to discover if we had any diamonds concealed. This practice had been established since time immemorial among those civilized nations that scour the seas. I was informed that the religious Knights of Malta never fail to make this search whenever any Moors of either sex fall into their hands. It is a part of the law of nations, from which they never deviate.\u201dIt looks like the law of nations didn\u2019t change much since then.Never trust a philosopher\u2026 Optimism is a loss of orientation in the surrounding reality\u2026",
            "Candide is an accessible masterpiece which demonstrated to the world Volatire's genius as a satirist. The eponymous Candide is a young man tutored by an optimist who is convinced according to the cause and effect philosophy of Leibniz and perhaps is best summarized in Voltaire's leitmotif that human beings live in the best of all possible worlds. Alexander Pope rather laughably made the same outrageous claim in his Essay on Man in which he writes",
            "Voltaire est avant tout l\u2019auteur d\u2019une tr\u00e8s abondante correspondance \u2014 des dizaines de milliers de lettres sur divers sujets philosophiques, adress\u00e9es \u00e0 tout le gratin europ\u00e9en de l\u2019\u00e9poque, aujourd\u2019hui disponibles en treize gros volumes dans la Pl\u00e9iade.

Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nouvelle philosophique, sans rien pourtant de sp\u00e9culatif, aucune argumentation compliqu\u00e9e : c\u2019est avant tout une histoire cocasse et divertissante, qui avance vitement et va droit au but. Combien d\u2019auteurs moins talentueux se seraient \u00e9tal\u00e9s sur des centaines de pages sans pour autant \u00eatre aussi profonds et amusants !Candide est une sorte de Bildungsroman avant la lettre : le jeune Candide est un b\u00e2tard \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans un ch\u00e2teau de Westphalie. Son percepteur, le Dr Pangloss, lui enseigne \u00ab qu\u2019il n\u2019y a point d\u2019effet sans cause, et que, dans ce meilleur des mondes possibles, le ch\u00e2teau de monseigneur le baron [est] le plus beau des ch\u00e2teaux et madame la meilleure des baronnes possibles \u00bb (Pl\u00e9iade, p. 146). Peu apr\u00e8s, Candide s\u2019envoie en l\u2019air avec Cun\u00e9gonde, la plus app\u00e9tissante des filles de baron possible, et est renvoy\u00e9 illico avec un coup de pied au derri\u00e8re.S\u2019ensuit une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nement proprement d\u00e9sastreux, qui l\u2019\u00e9loignent de son pays natal et de Mlle Cun\u00e9gonde, lui font faire un demi-tour du monde et conna\u00eetre la boucherie guerri\u00e8re, la maladie, la torture, les ex\u00e9cutions capitales, les catastrophes naturelles (dont le tremblement de terre de Lisbonne de 1755), le meurtre, le viol, le cannibalisme, l\u2019esclavage, les gal\u00e8res, j\u2019en passe et des meilleures. Moyennant quoi, les pr\u00e9ceptes optimistes du bon Pangloss sont mis \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve, si bien que Candide finit par trouver, par lui-m\u00eame, une sorte de sagesse r\u00e9sign\u00e9e. Le roman, en effet s\u2019ach\u00e8ve par cette fameuse allusion \u00e0 \u00c9picure : \u00ab mais il faut cultiver notre jardin \u00bb (p. 233).Il y a, au fond, dans l\u2019histoire de Candide quittant son ch\u00e2teau et d\u00e9couvrant la souffrance et la mort, quelque chose qui rappelle la jeunesse du Bouddha (la l\u00e9gende du prince Siddhartha Gautama qui, lui aussi, sortit de son ch\u00e2teau\u2026). Au bout du compte, ces deux personnages finissent par trouver, pour l\u2019un l\u2019illumination c\u00e9leste, pour l\u2019autre une forme de lucidit\u00e9 terrestre.A l\u2019\u00e9vidence, Candide est un pied de nez au syst\u00e8me philosophique de Leibniz qui, pour faire court, dans ses Essais de Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e sur la bont\u00e9 de Dieu, la libert\u00e9 de l'homme et l'origine du mal, sp\u00e9culait sur le fait que, parmi l\u2019infinit\u00e9 des mondes possibles, celui o\u00f9 nous sommes est, en effet, le meilleur. Voltaire, consid\u00e9rant cette th\u00e9orie ahurissante, \u00e9crivait d\u00e9j\u00e0, dans une lettre au leibnizien Kahle : \u00ab Quand vous aurez aussi d\u00e9montr\u00e9, en vers ou autrement, pourquoi tant d\u2019hommes s\u2019\u00e9gorgent dans le meilleur des mondes possibles, je vous serai tr\u00e8s oblig\u00e9. \u00bbCe faisant, \u00e0 travers ce petit roman, Voltaire fait \u00e9galement assaut au Dieu de la religion chr\u00e9tienne, que l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence du Mal dans le monde semble devoir r\u00e9futer. Plus encore, Candide, avec ses Inquisiteurs, ses autodaf\u00e9s, ses pr\u00eatres corrompus et ses moines dissolus, est une attaque en r\u00e8gle contre l\u2019\u00c9glise catholique. Pas \u00e9tonnant que, au milieu du XVIII\u00e8me, ce roman ait senti quelque peu le souffre\u2026Je ne serais pas surpris d\u2019apprendre que Voltaire ait lu Jonathan Swift, tant ils partagent le m\u00eame ton tout \u00e0 la fois mordant, satirique, fantaisiste et spirituel. L\u2019influence des romans picaresques espagnols (Don Quichotte ?) et des Mille et une nuits (dans la traduction de Galland) est peut-\u00eatre \u00e9galement sensible dans la mani\u00e8re dont Voltaire construit son r\u00e9cit.Il semble enfin possible que Candide ait exerc\u00e9 une influence sur Sade \u2014 Justine est une sorte d\u2019avatar de Candide, qui subit toute sortes d\u2019outrages, mais qui continue malgr\u00e9 tout de philosopher avec ses agresseurs. Dans un autre genre, Thackeray s\u2019est peut-\u00eatre aussi inspir\u00e9 de Voltaire \u2014 son Barry Lyndon est encore un autre rejeton de Candide, certes plus arriviste et moins philosophe. Plus pr\u00e8s de nous, des romans comme Catch-22, Slaughterhouse-Five ou The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sont aussi de lointains descendants de Candide.",
            "\u201cIf this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others?\u201dIf the world was created to drive us mad, as one character in Candide suggests",
            "Zounds! This book is wildly entertaining and I giggled all the way through Candide's awful adventures. Who would have thought that murder, rape, slavery, sexual exploitation, natural disaster, pillaging, theft, and every other oppression imaginable could be so funny?Here's some pretty good insight from the old woman with one buttock:I have been a hundred times upon the point of killing myself",
            "Candide is a real crush! Simply magical. I knew this novel but had never had the pleasure of reading it. Here it is! Candide is the hero of this philosophical tale; he is a character who lives up to his name, who wants to be optimistic and who believes in life. We know that he was born in Westphalia, a German kingdom, and is the son of the sister of Sir Baron de Thunder-ten-tronckh. The latter will raise him with his daughter, Miss Cun\u00e9gonde, his wife and a philosopher, Pangloss, whose moral is all is well in this world. However",
            "In only about 100 pages, Voltaire says more than your average 7 book series... Which would be great if most of what he talked about wasn't dated into irrelevance. So unless you're a French scholar, appreciating his satire seems unrealistic. Combine that with the speed at which the plot moves, and keeping up with Candide is definitely a chore. Truly enjoying his adventure seems like a privilege only possible for the super-educated. At one time, Candide was a must-read. But, for the average person, that time probably passed a hundred years ago.",
            "In the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronchkh in Westphalia",
            "This is a truly hilarious satire which starts with poor Candide being kicked out of the castle where he was born and brought up, after he falls in love with the baron\u2019s daughter, Cunegonde. Then his troubles begin, and he ends up travelling all around the world looking for his beloved.Candide experiences trial after trial, each one as bad and as far-fetched as the last. However, the way in which these trials were described did not make one feel too sorry for him; the story had more of the feel of a tragicomedy, especially with the speed of events and the gross exaggerations.Candide\u2019s mentor, the philosopher, Pangloss, was such an infuriating yet funny character. He maintains that \u201c\u2026everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds\u201d and stubbornly sticks by this maxim. This book is a bildungsroman of sorts because we see what Candide makes of that supposition throughout his trials. Voltaire spares nobody in his attack on society. \u201cFigure to yourself all the contradictions, and all the absurdities possible, and you will find them in the church, in the government, in the tribunals, and in the theatres of this droll nation.\u201dI can only imagine what an uproar this book must have created when it was first published. All in all, a very funny book.",

            "While fruitlessly searching for something decent to read, I invariably come across a ton of acclaim for total hacks being labeled as \u2018master satirists\u2019. God that pisses me off, especially since none of those books are worth a damn, and while the authors wrongly think they have something interesting or unique to say, the thing that really disheartens me is that someone out there agrees with them. For each of these books, there should be a simple label affixed to the front cover that reads \u2018Not As Good As Candide\u2019. I seriously think this would alleviate about 30% of all my unresolved issues with the public\u2019s perception of what makes for decent reading. The other 70% could be resolved by making major overhauls to a universal \u2018required reading\u2019 list: The Great Gatsby, eh\u2026.let\u2019s just toss that crap out and put Cosmos on there, how about actually learning something while you read?\tI\u2019m not about to give Candide a perfect score, and I don\u2019t think that it deserves one, but I will say that it\u2019s damn good. It seems that some of the popular philosophy making the rounds back in Francois-Marie\u2019s day was just rubbing him wrong, especially the absolutely moronic concept that we live in \u2018the best of all possible worlds\u2019. Most people hear something that weak and simply binge drink to erase the awful memory that somebody out there could possibly believe that kind of shit. A lot of people write against these notions and somehow get their pitiful little whims published in the commentary of the local newspaper, and you wish you could choke those imbeciles as well, for giving more press to an already absurd concept. Lastly, there are the few that decide to sit down and write a satire about a hundred pages long to denounce what they consider absolute folly. \tAnd with Candide, Voltaire relentlessly attacks the ridiculous philosophy of Liebniz and his familiars, attempting to show that this is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the best of all possible worlds (mainly because of the large number of utter clods totally f--king up the works). Our hero, Candide, is a naive youth being reared in the castle of a Westphalian Baron, living the good life while being tutored by a total fraud and hack named Pangloss, the Baron\u2019s oracle/scholar. The only hindrance in the life of our featherbedded little friend is that his love interest, Cunogonde, happens to be the Baron\u2019s vivacious 17-year old daughter, and the Baron isn\u2019t about to have his daughter betrothed to some chump lacking the amount of noble ancestry suitable to his standards. The soothing, silver tongue of Pangloss has made an indelible mark on Candide, however, and when the opportunity arises to plant a surreptitious smooch on Cunegonde, he\u2019s busted in the act and driven from the castle \u201cwhen the Baron saluted Candide with some notable kicks on the rear\u201d. That\u2019s just hilarious, 'notable kicks', and there\u2019s something this appealing on basically every page to follow: as this is only just the beginning; the first misfortune to befall our thick-skulled friend, Candide. Each successive f--king he suffers along the way is not only totally hilariously described in an absurd fashion, but is usually resolved in awesomely unreal turns of fate (I don\u2019t think I could make it more than five pages without either cracking a smile or outright laughing for all the right reasons). The Baron\u2019s castle is sacked by Bulgarians following Candide\u2019s exile, setting the lively and luscious Cunegonde in flight from Westphalia as well, and one unfortunate event after another befalls both lovers; with Candide\u2019s life quickly becoming filled with floggings, poverty, the Inquisition. natural disasters, piracy, and getting pimp-jacked as a result of some devious manipulation, while his beloved is reduced to harlotry, being ravished or ravaged, and unbecoming servitude at the hands of her completely offensive captors and suitors. Wow. It probably isn\u2019t the best book you\u2019ll ever read, but I'd be pretty shocked to find out it wasn't even enjoyed.",
            "The best part of this book was that it ended and with a happily ever after.",
            "This is quite a remarkable book \u2013 a satirical attack on the notion that we live in the best of all possible worlds and that therefore all that happens in such a world invariably happens for the best. Voltaire is supposed to have written the whole thing in barely three days \u2013 a rather productive half-week.What I found particularly interesting here was the discussion of war \u2013 how the horrors of war are presented in such an off-hand way and almost invariably the utter inhumanity of what is described (rape and even eating half of someone\u2019s bum) is just chalked up to \u2018the way things are\u2019. The question of free will, human agency and responsibility for our actions \u2013 something that the notion of our living in the best of all possible worlds does much to undermine \u2013 is never far from the surface here, but invariably it remains just under the surface. This is a \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019 book \u2013 even if the showing is heavy-handed in the extreme. It would take a particularly committed optimist to go through what the characters in this book do and come out the other end still thinking the world is beyond any possibility of improvement.What I particularly liked, though, was the very end and the garden that is being tended. It is through Candide\u2019s labours to create this garden that he finally finds some sense of human dignity, stability and even a kind of happiness. The book is otherwise the odyssey of a fool, but this final acceptance of life as struggle and a kind of stoic acceptance of the rewards that come from labour is quite a lovely thing, really. Even before I got to the end I kept thinking the whole way through the book about how different Eastern and Western notions of these things are and have been. When the Buddha was first confronted by the world outside his idyllic palace he realised life was suffering. It is odd that when we in the West are confronted with much the same vision of the world around us we all too often excuse that suffering as being necessary for the greater good. This little book by Voltaire shows such inhumanity isn\u2019t a necessary assumption of the Western tradition, that sometimes even we can be shocked by the horrors we inflict on others and even humbled by suffering.",
            "This book does not stick so well in my memory in either a negative or positive way, but I think this comes from the book being a mixture of two things which I could not feel more differently about: allegory and satire.The first I find to be as silly and pointless as Aesop or Passion Plays. Characters in an allegory are oversimplified symbols, and so cannot comment on the nature of actual human beings. The style is already so firmly affixed to cultural states and norms that it cannot really say anything beyond the dichotomous, and dualists are blinded by their egos.I do love satire, but that is generally because of the wit and skill it takes to subvert and re-imagine. Unfortunately, once one has drawn so deeply on hyperbole in a work, it loses its ability to find that necessarily uncomfortable 'grey area'--that rift between assumption and observation.Voltaire is witty and funny, but his condemnation and praise falls only on unrealistic absolutes, and hence becomes only political rather than philosophical. In this, he becomes in many ways Shakespeare's opposite; whose characters were so vaguely sketched that they could be held representative of many disparate identities.It is too easy to force and distort arguments when the accepted givens are so strictly defined and counterpointed. This problem should be evident to anyone in America today who sees how opposition to ideas is transformed into meaninglessly pejorative identities. The temptation of thought-terminating cliches grows ever more in the face of such opposing forces as Voltaire presents.No doubt much of Voltaire's popularity stems from the fact that he is so narrowly applicable and divisive. In this way he almost works like a philosopher since his ideas are so forcefully professed. However, unlike a philosopher he represents his opponents in a state of utter ridicule, he is less convincing than polarizing.The other part of Voltaire's popularity comes from his empty century. The Seventeenth had Shakespeare and Milton. The Nineteenth showed the ridiculously fecund blossoming of the Romantics. The Eighteenth, however, has Fielding, Swift, Voltaire, and Pope. Fielding has escaped as wide a reading because his satire was more social than strictly political. Pope and Swift were likewise satirists, but of such a fanciful nature as to escape more simplistic and contentious forces. This leaves us with the more accessible Voltaire, who may be used to attack ideas, but not to build upon them.",
            "Not bought this book last time we visited Foyles; since it was lying around, I couldn't resist the temptation to read it again. You can read Candide any number of times. A particularly fine passage which I had forgotten, from the Eldorado sequence:Cacambo expliquait les bons mots du roi \u00e0 Candide, et quoique traduits, ils paraissaient toujours des bons mots. De tout ce qui \u00e9tonnait Candide, ce n'\u00e9tait pas ce qui l'\u00e9tonna le moins.Cacambo explained the king's witty remarks to Candide, and, although they had been translated, they were still witty. Of all the things that astonished Candide, this was not the one that astonished him least."

Her mom is coming to visit, and that worries Jane, because Mom comes across as a paragon of perfection\u2014something that bothers Jane, as it would any of us. How does Jane entertain Mom? Is there something they can do together to make the visit more harmonious? It isn\u2019t long before Jane, her mother, and Jane\u2019s close friend, Shelley Nowack are taking a memoir-writing class at the community college.Agnes Pryce is a local author who treats everyone in the class horribly. None of the other students like her, and she insists that they join her for a potluck lunch. Jane brings a quiche, Agnes eats it, and Agnes soon dies. No way did Jane want the old woman dead, and it\u2019s up to her with the help of dreamy Officer Mel Vandyne to figure out how the poison got in the quiche that killed Agnes Pryce. There\u2019s no shortage of suspects; Pryce treated everyone in the class horribly. She accused the town mayor of embezzlement. Jane\u2019s mom was an embassy hanger-on, referring to her husband\u2019s work prior to retirement. The teacher of the class, a romance writer, crafts porn, according to Agnes Pryce. No one gets a break from the sharp tongue and nasty disposition of the woman.The book is super short, but it\u2019s long on great writing and great characters. Jane and Shelley are amazing together, and part of that amazing is that their differences are vivid and complement one another. I can\u2019t help but celebrate the family closeness of the Jeffry clan. The glimpses of the two boys you get in this book indicate that two fine men are evolving, and credit goes to a great mom. In short, these are fictional characters with whom I\u2019m comfortable. I didn\u2019t see how this would turn out, and you\u2019d think with a book this short, I would have.

They don't have planned times to meet up. They just come over to each others houses, probably those of you who are use to living in a place were houses are right next to each other might be use to this kind of flow in your life, but although mom and me have lived in a small town that is not one of the things that makes up part of our lives. Anyway Jane mom arrives and Jane's who was little worried about her mom's visit, no because her mom was a terrible mother, just that they have never spent much time together.

They are never boring people, and there are always at least a handful mom and I would love to meet in person. Except for one class member. A nice mean shrew of a woman who says mean things about everyone. I know you are shocked to learn she is killed of, but the true question is who killed her? It was during a dinner that was attended by the class, yet now one in the class seems cruel enough to off the old busy body. Watching Jane and Shelley try a figure out who killed the old lady while trying not to being accusative of the class mates is a beautiful thing and one must experience first hand by reading this book.",

They all decide to take a one-week autobiography writing class. When one of the participants is murdered, it points the finger at everyone else in the class. As usual, Jane doesn't feel that Mel is moving forward quickly enough, so she and Shelley decide to do some investigating on their own. I like that they just ask questions among acquaintances within their town, nothing crazy, although of course, if they accidentally contact the killer, then they've put themselves (and their families) in danger. Jane is cautiously beginning a relationship with Mel, much to her daughter's chagrin. Jane's also enjoying her writing so much that she's considering continuing with it as a potential career. I had planned to give this a 4-star rating, but unfortunately the reveal turned out to be so convoluted\\, that I had to remove one whole star. It all made sense eventually, but it seemed awfully farfetched and contrived.

I loved the characters and by the end of the book I felt like they were some of my friends. Friends who I would love to visit again and again. The writing style was fluid and easy to follow and I felt like the people in the book were real.

The first evening, harridan Mrs. General Pryce insults everyone. The second evening, they have dinner at Mrs. Pryce's home and she is poisoned. Jane must, of course, find the killer. Romantic interest with detective Mel VanDyne escalates.",

They're FUN, ok? I mean, Heart of Darkness is great, but after a hard day slogging it out at work? This is pure escapist literature, and I highly recommend it.",

It took seven chapters before the victim died. For my taste, I wanted more suspense as the story went on. The main character was never in any danger. She simply figured it out. ",

            "There were a few small contradictions that were annoying in this book. The author seems to rely on unremarkable dialogue to move the story along. I was interested enough to read until the end to learn who the killer was, but I will not be reading any other titles from this author."

In Angola he falls helplessly in love with Ana Olimpia Vaz de Caminha, who was born a slave and yet becomes one of the country's richest women.

Adorei tamb\u00e9m saber, j\u00e1 ia avan\u00e7ada no livro, que E\u00e7a de Queiroz efetivamente escreveu um livro designado \u00abA Correspond\u00eancia de Fradique Mendes\u00bb, em que cria esta personagem que seria um seu amigo. Creio ser precisa muita imagina\u00e7\u00e3o para Agualusa encarnar este ser e, tal como E\u00e7a, escrever em seu nome.Gostei muito!

Reading this book will help students understand that everyone has bad dreams but we can always turn them into good ones. After reading this book, discussions can follow to help children have better night sleep, especially when they use their imagination. Books: Two other books that can be used as social stories to teach about bad dreams are Bye-Bye Bad Dreams by Stephanie Robinson and Little Rabbit and the Night Mare by Kate Klise.

            "Genre: Picture Book- ConceptSummary: Vivid photographs are used to convey the concept of opposites to a young child. No words are included, so the reader is left to infer the opposite words the photographs are displaying. Critique- I like that the wordless photography leaves this book open-ended to interpretation.Each two-page spread shows two similar photographs that are slightly changed to make them convey two opposite words. However, there are no words to accompany the photographs so the reader is forced to make a guess at what the author is trying to convey. The way the possibilities are left open-ended leaves a lot of room for differentiation. Students on all levels are able to stay engaged with this book. Higher-level thinkers might challenge themselves to think of the most creative opposite words to accompany the photographs. One of the two-page spreads shows a picture of a very large bear on one side, and two baby bears on the right-hand side that are fighting. Opposite words to go along with this could include: big/little, old/young, adult/baby, alone/together, gentle/rough, etc. The pictures not only encourage creativity, but also create a meaningful and realistic bond to the lesson.Curriculum Connection: While reading this book to the class, you could have the students act along with the story. For instance, if the words are up and down, have them stand up and sit down. You could call on different students to show how they would act out the two opposite words. The class could play opposite charades. The student might have to act out one word and the class guesses what it\u2019s opposite is. Students could also play memory and BINGO using opposite words. Students could draw pictures like the ones in the book, or even use a class camera to take two photos with the teach",
            "Another photo-illustrated wordless book with several possiblities for discussion on each page. The duck, for example, could be over/under, rightside up/upside down, hungry/fed, working/resting, relixing/busy, or possible considered dry/wet. While some of the subjects illustrated are not exact opposites (opuntia cactus is not exactly opposite of a possibe serrated-edged Agave or senecio succulent",
            "This wordless book has pictures of opposites that are very clear so short. Even if I try to find and show my toddler things that are the exact opposites, there are usually other distracting things that go along with it or more moving parts. It is nice to be able to show it to him clearly. It is also a book he can read by himself.",
            "Age of readership: 2-upGenre:Picture BookDiversity: Concepts of oppositesDescription of the illustrations:Color photographsPersonal response to the book: A nice book for toddlers learning the concept of opposites.Curricular and programming connections: The book can be used for preschool or library story time in learning about opposites.",
            "This would have been a great vocabulary book except some of the opposites were really hard to figure out. Some are clear- there is a picture of a closed gate on one page and an open gate on the opposite page. But there were several pages that were hard to find an opposite. I wouldn't use it unless I got could come up with some opposite choices for the difficult pages. ",
            "Exactly the Opposite is a book that teaches young children what the word opposite means through pictures. While the book contains no words, the reader can look through the pictures and know what the word opposite means. For example, there was a picture of an open fence and then the next picture was a closed fence. This book is great for readers of very young ages.",
            "There were too many combinations in this book I did not get. A plastic water bottle, and then a flattened plastic water bottle- where is the opposite there? My husband labeled them as usable and unusable. What kid is going to get that?"

Lawrence, first published privately in 1928 in Italy, and in 1929 in France and Australia. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960.The story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper class husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, has been paralysed from the waist down due to a Great War injury. In addition to Clifford's physical limitations, his emotional neglect of Constance forces distance between the couple. Her emotional frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class. The novel is about Constance's realization that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. ...\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e

(NOTE TO SELF: Stop judging people's judgements until you can judge for yourself!)But the fact is, two-thirds of the way in I was done with this. I absolutely trudged through to the end. Why? It's not because this is basically porn. I luuuuvs me the sex! Apparently this caused quite a scandal and I can see why. The language is sexually explicit, unnecessarily so...or well, maybe not. I suppose it needed to be said at the time or at least some time. However, a person can only take so many fucks before they no longer give one.And I wasn't turned off by the lengthy asides Lawrence takes while grinding his ax against the industrialization of England's Midlands. Like Melville's treatise on whales in the midst of his adventure novel, Lawrence had an agenda in writing Lady Chatterley's Lover and he often takes the reader out of the main story in order to linger upon his pet project. That can be distracting, but in this case it's not enough to make me hate the thing, not on the whole.No, my main issue is with the writing, which is a big problem since there's so much of it in books. Lawrence is quite a capable writer, but he does get adverb-lazy now and then, and often repeats words for emphasis. That last point can be effective, say when trying to instill a sense of forward motion when describing something that's going faster and faster. Occasionally the technique works for him. Usually it does not work for me. Some call it a poetic style. I call it bullshit...what do I mean? Well, allow me to Lawrence-ify it: The technique is bullshit in the most bullshitty sense, by which I mean, it is bullshit. As you see, it looks like I've explained myself, yet I've said nothing. Done with flair, it can sound lyrical, even powerful. To me, it sounds like so much hot air. And what does hot air sound like? It sounds like",
            "Ah, D.H. Lawrence, why are you so awesome?I think Lawrence is one of those writers you either love or hate, and this is possibly even more true of Lady Chatterley's Lover, his last novel. The author's confidence speaks on every page: firstly, Lawrence has no qualms about interjecting his opinion in the narration throughout. Secondly, the book is from the perspective of a woman, a challenge for any male author, and thirdly (and possibly most famously), the book makes liberal use of fuck and cunt. It's not just that the book is about sexual awakening",

Whether discussing films or food, feminism or fantasy, science fiction or sex, Carter consistently explores new territories and overturns old ideas. From her hilarious deconstruction of \"Gone With the Wind\" and a delightfully wicked description of a Japanese fertility festival to enchanting accounts of her early childhood adventures or the irreverent reevaluations of D. H. Lawrence, H. P. Lovecraft, and Elizabeth David, this marvelous companion to \"Burning Your Boats,\" which collected Carter's short fiction, firmly places her among the most accomplished writers of this century.

            "\u2018Books about books is fun but frivolous,\u2019 Angela Carter once said to an interviewer \u2013 which just goes to show that she, unlike most, was capable of proving herself wrong. This collection of her reviews, essays, articles and general criticism is definitely fun but far from frivolous \u2013 on the contrary, having it all here in one brick-sized articulation gives it the contours of quite a serious cumulative argument, one focused on the intersection of eroticism, feminism, intellectual frustration and dry wit. And it's useful to have it. I always liked the baroque, oneiric oddness of her fiction, but I never quite understood what argument or philosophy was motivating it. Now, I feel like I do.Carter was born in 1940, the year after Germaine Greer and Margaret Atwood, and one way to think about her is to recognise that she, like them, grew up imbibing and driving and reshaping the same intellectual currents of second-wave feminism and power politics. (If only she, like them, had also lived long enough to make bloody-minded comments on the latest iterations of the gender debates.) Feminism is, for her, not so much a political position as an inherent facet of her common sense, and when you read Angela Carter on gender issues (which is an utter joy), you never feel that she's writing to work out some animus against anyone.Rarely, in other words, is she interested in facile attributions of blame. Instead, her basic position is one of bemused frustration, which she makes seem incredibly productive. Surveying the profusion of women's magazines, for instance, she examines the photo-strips and romance tips confusedly, before concluding:It is as if marriage functions as the sexuality of women. It occupies the imagination of these magazines to the same obsessive extent that sexuality itself does in the tit mags. Perhaps, like the tit mags, these magazines do not truly reflect the central preoccupations of the readers.This is a theme she develops in several pieces \u2013 nowhere more thrillingly than in a virtuoso essay called \u2018Alison's Giggle\u2019 which she wrote in 1983 for a book called The Left and the Erotic. The essay's title comes from an incident in The Miller's Tale where, if you remember, a cheating wife sticks her bottom out of the window and contrives for her cuckolded husband, who is confused by the darkness, to kiss her arse. This makes Alison the wife giggle \u2013 as Chaucer tells us (\u2018Tehee! quod she\u2019).Carter takes this bawdy heroine as a foundational example in English literature of \u2018the assumption that men and women share an equal knowledge of the basic facts of sexual experience\u2019, an assumption that lasts \u2018up until, curiously enough, that very time in the eighteenth century when women in significant numbers take up their pens and write\u2019. It's a thesis she follows through Austen, Eliot, Colette, and up to Doris Lessing and Jean Rhys, full of fascinating detours and pointed conclusions on how women are treated in literature.But at least Alison managed to get herself fucked by the man of her choice, to her own satisfaction and with no loss of either her own self-respect or the respect of her male creator, which is more than a girl like her will be able to do again, in fiction, for almost more than half a millennium.Though fair-minded and full of humour, she is especially fun to read when she does take exception to something. She opens a review of Arthur Marwick's Beauty in History by noting drily that the authorcertainly knows what he likes and a fitting subtitle for Beauty in History might be: \u2018Women I have fancied throughout the ages with additional notes on some of the men I think I might have fancied if I were a woman\u2019.Carter pauses to ponder, uncensoriously, \u2018the way in which appearance functions as a kind of visible sexuality for women\u2019; then, with that hanging in the air, she turns her attention back to Marwick's approach. Ruthlessly unpicking the prurience underlying his book, and quoting him to devastating effect (\u2018Twiggy, with her 31-inch bust, had beautiful, small but perfectly proportioned breasts, as can be seen from the photograph of her in a bikini reproduced III, 116\u2019), Carter summons up a sort of dismissive indulgence which is more withering than any denunciation:There is something almost \u2013 but, again, not quite \u2013 touching about the boyish enthusiasm Professor Marwick evinces towards his subject. There are whole pages off which one can feel the acne rise.Christ! One pictures Professor Marwick limping towards the nearest burns centre\u2026. In real life (she says, in the introduction to Expletives Deleted), she is \u2018notoriously foul-mouthed\u2019, and spent a lot of time when writing reviews struggling to translate her initial reactions (\u2018bloody awful\u2019, \u2018fucking dire\u2019) into more high-minded language. The results are impressive.Of course, it helps that the range of her interests is so broad \u2013 in here is everything from travelogues of Japanese fertility festivals, through reviews of Bertolucci, to a Bob Dylan gig in 1966 (\u2018thin and black-clad and linear, a Beardsley hobgoblin\u2019), from thoughts on fashion and cooking, all the way to explorations of fanzines and an investigation into the ethics of HP Lovecraft's horror stories (in which \u2018Evil is\u2026it is not what men do\u2019).She was a powerhouse, and this collection \u2013 huge but still not complete \u2013 makes you miss her voice more than ever. No one has really replaced her, and indeed, reading through Shaking a Leg, you wonder how anyone could.",
            "Angela Carter thinks everything looks like a penis. Or a vagina, or maybe, occasionally, a tit. Partly this is because she seems to spend half her time traveling to Japanese penis festivals, but mostly it's because, you know, she's one of those feminists who think everything looks like a penis.At my right-on university, you were expected to agree with her about everything, but not, bizarrely, to have actually read anything she wrote. It was presented as dogma, rather than thought, which is a shame since she turns out to be far more open-minded and witty than her acolytes.I saw someone else had described this book in a one-word review as sharp",
            "What started as secondary material for my thesis became a source of infinite inspiration. Carter has such a bright, associative mind - don't be distracted by the titles of her pieces. Every piece is worth reading. Every piece has something of value. ",
            "Very good essays mainly written in the 1960s-1980s. Angela Carter presents a clear picture of life in Britain during those times. If you enjoy reading essays that are both wry and humorous I think you\u2019ll have fun reading this book.",
            "Angela Carter on evil in the works of H.P. Lovecraft:Evil is. . . It is not what men do. Evil is an abstraction",
            "Carter's essay are entertaining and thought provoking. Also, very often funny. In this collection, there are book reviews, travelogues, and political commentary. My favorite essay is the comparison/contrast essay about Paddington and Winne the Pooh."

            "Own. The majority of the book is reference for planning each grade. The introduction and first chapter give the background and pep talk similar -- but informed completely and explicitly by her faith -- to Susan Wise Bauer's in WTM. Her goal was not only to give her children the classical education that the Catholics have not completely lost as American evangelicals have, but also to give her children a full-orbed culture of faith. She wanted not simply to avoid evolution, but to positively immerse her children in the history and culture of their faith. That's something the Catholics are better at than we are, but something I hope at least Reformed Christians are regaining (CRE more than any).This will be a useful book, and I will revisit her first chapter for a pep talk when I need it.",

            "Thanks to COVID and having a child with cystic fibrosis, a lot of school reopening options just were not going to work for our family. After many days/hours of research and friends\u2019 suggestions, I landed on MODG as our foundation for beginning homeschooling in our home. I read this fast and am more at ease with the decision we\u2019ve made for our children. Plenty of resources out there for those that are interested! ",
            "This is the definitive resource to give your child a Catholic, classical education. Berquist is a wise and thoughtful guide - she\u2019s most worthy of your attention. ",
            "This book isn\u2019t designed to provide a deep look at either the philosophical or the practical questions of classical education. Instead, although the forward offers a brief overview of the writings that influenced Mrs. Berquist\u2019s \u201ctake\u201d on education, the bulk of the book consists of an outline of the subjects and curriculum she used to teach various grades. It\u2019s intended as a reassuring resource for busy moms who wonder what they really need to include to make sure their kids get a good education. I always appreciate hearing how other families have structured their children\u2019s home education, and I actually found this book surprisingly refreshing. At least in the homeschool circles I frequent, many classical and Charlotte Mason-influenced families today seem very keen to be whole-hearted--even \u201cpurist\u201d--in their educational approaches. This can mean that they operate under a lot of \u201crules\u201d they feel they must follow. In contrast, Mrs. Berquist, a homeschooler of the past generation, seems cheerfully ready to cite both For the Children\u2019s Sake and Dorothy Sayer\u2019s famous essay as formative influences on her own outlook. She refers to stages of learning, but doesn\u2019t seem to interpret this as requiring young children to memorize anything other than poetry. She talks a lot about having children \u201ctell back\u201d what they have learned, but doesn\u2019t attempt to recreate the \u201ccorrect method\u201d of Charlotte Mason narration. I rather liked that. I plan to keep this book around and glance at her recommendations as my kids get older. ",
            "The title is incredibly misleading. This isn\u2019t a guide to creating your own curriculum, rather it is a curriculum that you can adjust if needed. It doesn\u2019t give the ins and outs of creating a curriculum. It gives you a curriculum and gives you some minor choices along the way. While the idea behind it is classical, the actual curriculum plan feels more traditional to me. It is very similar to, but much more limited than, The Well Trained Mind. If you are wanting a classical-ish curriculum that is pretty much done for you\u2014 this is your book. If you\u2019re wanting to actually design your own curriculum, this is not the book. If your wanting everything laid out but with more options, The Well Trained Mind is your book. ",
            "Really useful resource but somewhat dated as many homeschool and classical oriented materials have appeared in the last 20 years. So a great place to start but definitely be prepared to do some legwork after reading.",
            "Designing Your Own Classical Curriculum, written by the woman who edited The Harp and Laurel Wreath: Poetry and Dictation for the Classical Curriculum, is not an apologetics manual for homeschooling or classical education, but rather a practical suggestion for what to cover in each grade and how. I find it helpful to read about what other families have done and found successful, so I can tweak what might work for us.Although the book is classical in focus, the author does draw heavily from Charlotte Mason, emphasizing short lessons, memory work, living books, nature study, narration, artist and composer study, and habit training. Because the book is about individualizing your curriculum, you could easily make substitutions in subject areas where you disagree with the author. For example, if you are not Catholic (as I am not) you could glean some helpful ideas from the history section, but would probably prefer to select different focus areas in some respects.{Read my more detailed review on A Spirited Mind}"

        "description": "The Sundering Flood, among the last of Morris's works, was published in 1897, after his death. The beautiful prose and rich use of language are typical of Morris and fill the reader with a sense of awe and wonder. The \"flood\" of the title is nothing less than a river, metaphorically as well as literally dividing two lovers. And there is the fantastic, too: dwarf folk, a magic sword, and an ageless warrior to mentor the hero. All told, a delightful story certain to appeal to all lovers of classic fantasy. \"C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien both acknowledged the influence of William Morris.\" --The Encyclopedia of Fantasy \"No mountains in literature are as far away as the distant mountains of Morris.\" --C.S. Lewis \"With his epochal novels of the 1880s, William Morris established the tradition of the tale set in a completely imaginary world of the author's own invention.? --Lin Carter",

            "At about the 2/3 mark I started to reconsider what this was about. It is clearly in the vein of a chivalrous romance, its events and adventures unspooling as though from a storyteller's tongue, all sort of strung together and barely contained by the basic frame of Osberne's courtly romance with Elfhild and his long and undirected quest to regain her.But eventually the tale reaches the siege and battle for the City of the Sundering Flood, which despite the author's affectedly archaic language turns out to be a masterpiece of efficient storytelling: the battle actions, the factions, the politics, and its resolution. It is not medieval fantasy as I have (inexpertly) thought of it.Further, soon afterward the perspective flips and Elfhild's story is told in flashback. Where Osberne had joined the forces of the Knight of Longshaw, Elfhild falls in with a member of the Barons' League, who are the other side in this conflict. This is never quite a full alternate viewpoint--the reader's sympathies are clearly with Longshaw--but is such an interesting device that one can only wonder what Morris could have wrought of this hurried and somewhat crash-landing ending if he had the proper time for it, rather than being forced to dictate the draft on his deathbed. ",
            "The last of Morris's fantasies is definitely the one I like best. It starts off on the banks of the eponymous mighty river, where a young girl and boy meet, but separated by the waters of the Sundering Flood. The boy becomes a mighty youth with the help of magic; the girl becomes pretty. Adventures follow. This worked for me, but it did bog down in some of the adventures--after the supernatural elements and the colorful setting of the beginning, we're back to standard knightly stuff.",
            "This is more of a bibliographic note than a review. There are a number of editions offered on-line, notably at The Internet Archive (archive.org), and someone looking for a (free) copy there may find this information helpful. I also identify a free Kindle book. There are some minor editorial problems with the text of this posthumously-published, not-quite-finished, work, to which I will return.I will say that this is one of my two favorites among Morris' fantasy romances from the last decade of the nineteenth century, along with The Water of the Wondrous Isles -- in which Water means the lake in which there are islands",
            "This has probably been my favorite of William Morris\u2019s books that I\u2019ve read. I was thoroughly pleased with the plot, the characters, the sense of setting both geographically and within history, and was delighted by the way in which the mystical or supernatural was gently weaved into the story without being a central focus. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll read this book again, and the next time I promise to write the review closer to when I actually read the book. ",
            "No, I'm not into romance books! But this tale by Morris is fitting for the Pre-Raphaelites who probably loved it while sitting by a stream with their lovlies... A beautiful tale of love and separation and how things come around again. Most of all I loved the words, the use of words to create beautiful English sentences. It is rare today. I like modern lingo but this is refreshing to read.",
            "Dictated while on his death bed, this is Morris' last novel. It was edited posthumously by his daughter May. Separated lovers, a tyrannical king, a magical sword, invading forces, a wise woman skilled in magical arts and perilous adventures fill out this tale in which, like all of his fantasy, Morris tried to revive the tradition of chivalrous romance and did so with multiple plot threads and relatively archaic language. Not remembered; scheduled for re-reading.",
            "DNF at ~20%. An enjoyable story, but I found the language too challenging to really get into, and the pace too slow to sustain my interest. "

            "The Journal of Joshua Loper: A Black Cowboy, is a fictionalized diary written convincingly by Walter Dean Myers. It is a Dear America book, a series that had a place on school library shelves in the 1990's and early 2000's. My belief as a school librarian is that students would gravitate toward reading this book if it were part of a class project. I had noticed different Dear America books through the years, and appreciate the effort to bring history to life through characters that young people might be able to relate to, about the trials of a different time period. I had just finished The Little House series, and am trying to read different perspectives of Westward Expansion, in this case where Joshua is a sixteen year old young man learning how to be a cowboy along The Chisholm Trail in Texas, in 1871. His mother had taught him to read, plus he was a good shot with a rifle, he was eager to learn how to be a cowboy, and we learn that he could sing; all of these skills make him an asset to the team.  Mr. Muhlen, who owns the ranch, hired Captain Hunter to manage the ranch and workers and to manage a crew to drive the herd of cattle from Texas to Abilene, Kansas. When Joshua is asked, I said I would do my best. Ain't nobody who went up the trail was talked about like they was a boy. You went up the trail you were a man (p. 4). There are references to slavery",

His Father is off somewhere else to find a job and has to leave behind his worried Mother. Joshua Loper talks about some of the situations and obstacles they face plus the interactions between him and the other cowboys while on a cattle drive. The book is based loosely off a real cowboy. Some of the story line is off putting but it does give a very real peek into the life of a Cowboy on a Cattle drive. I have been enjoying reading this series. ",

        "description": "Like any teenager, Natalie wants to have fun. But it's 1944, and almost all the boys she knows have signed up and are being shipped overseas to fight the war in Europe. Too often she takes the trip to Union Station to wave goodbye to another friend, wondering if he'll ever come home again. And like her other girlfriends, Natalie is getting tired of waiting for the war to be over. There are still dances at the Armories to meet handsome boys in uniform, but is that all a girl can do for the war effort?Natalie has a plan. Her first move was to change her name from Beryl, which didn't sound sophisticated at all. Now she quits school and takes a job at a department store. Buying War Saving Stamps with her meager earnings is not enough for Natalie, however, and soon she finds work at De Havilland Aircraft, making bombers. But it is during this time, when she is taking the most pride in her war work, that Natalie and her family get the news they've been dreading: her cousin, a gunner in the Dambusters Squadron, is listed as missing, presumed dead. And as news of other boys reaches home - some of it good but so much of it bad - Natalie begins to wonder what kind of world will be there for them all when the war finally ends.At times funny and at other times deeply moving, Bernice Thurman Hunter's last novel is drawn from her own memories of being a teenager in Toronto during World War II. In Natalie, Hunter has created a spunky, outspoken and utterly charming character, which readers young and old will revel in. And in her unforgettable portrait of the home front, Hunter has brought to life the daily trials and tribulations of a generation of women who had to stand by while their men went to war.",

            "This is a novel that was recommended to me by my Goodreads friend Emily. And I am so glad she did. Thanks, Emily.The Girls They Left Behind opens in June 1943 in Toronto, Canada. Beryl Brigham, 16, had decided two things: to get a summer job and to change her name to Natalie. But first she must attend her best friends wedding. Eloise is marrying her high school sweetheart just before he ships out to the war in Europe. In fact, all the boys are enlisting and shipping out, and it seems like the girls spend all their time at Union Station saying goodbye to friends and family.After working the summer in a department store and dissatisfied that all she can do for the war effort is buy War Saving Stamps, Natalie decides not to finish her last year of school and takes a job at the local factory making machine guns. Now 17, Natalie applies for and gets a job there, much to her parents unhappiness. Later, she gets a job with the help of an old high school friend at De Havilland Aircraft making bombers.So things are too bad for Natalie. She is making good money, able to save and help out at home, has a job and friends, and feels she is finally doing something important for the war effort. Things are good until war suddenly becomes real.First, her on again, off again boy friend turns 18 and enlists. Then her favorite cousin and best friend Carmen writes to her through his English girlfriend to avoid the censors and although Natalie received more news from him than is allowed, she nevertheless feels very jealous of Carmen\u2019s girlfriend Joan who sends the letters. When Carmen is recruited to be a gunner with a squadron called the Dambusters (because they blow up enemy dams), Natalie is told not to tell his mother. But when he is reported missing in action, the family is devastated by the news. Yet, Natalie still resents his girlfriend when Joan reaches out to her. At first annoyed that all the boys were going away just as she reached the age where she could have fun, Natalie must deal with some very grown up issues, especially as more and more familiar names start to appear on the missing or dead list. The Girls They Left Behind is a coming of age story told in part through diary entries and in part through first person narration. Natalie is a bit immature at the beginning, but as she learns to deal with responsibility, loss and the other deprivations of war, she must also learn to to know and accept who she really is - hopefully. I thought that the voice of Beryl/Natalie rings true because the story is based on the author\u2019s own experiences in Canada while growing up right down to working in the same department store.One of the interesting aspects ofThe Girls They Left Behind are the details of wartime Canada the author provides. For example, a lot of British soldiers were sent to Canada to train and, away from their own families at the holidays, they were invited into the homes of Canadians, just as the Brigham family does. And there is the leg make-up that Natalie had to use sparingly to make her legs appear to be wearing hose, or the ditty bags she, her mother and aunt made and filled to send to Carmen overseas. But not everything is about war. Best friends change, or drift away, old friends pop up and are again important for a while and once more fade in the background, only to resurface later - in other words, the ordinary life of a teenage girl is also played out in this story. And all of these details help to make this a funny, sad and well-rounded realistic novel. This book is recommended for readers age 12 and upThis book was borrowed from the Bronx Library Center branch of the NYPL",
            "Beryl/Natalie is a teenager in Toronto during the World War II. It's mostly written in diary form, but with a few-stand alone scenes scattered throughout--mostly towards the end of the book. The story deals with the feelings of always been left behind as she sees one more friend, relative, or neighbor off at the train station nearly every night--some of whom she will never see again. She drops out of school to work in an airplane factory and tries to go on with life, despite rations, black-outs, and no boys left to date.Beryl (who hates her name and is trying to change it to Natalie, if only her friends and family would remember to call her as such) is a real voice dealing with the frustrations of always being left behind, of British girls snatching away the Canadian boys when they're stationed overseas, and in being laid off and having to go back to school when the war is over and the most of the boys come home. Her voice is very straight forward and matter-of-fact:Dad had resurrected the Quebec heater from the garage and set it up in the kitchen so we would use less coal in the furnace. Coal was scarce these days because it was needed in factories like The Steel Company of Canada. Dad said the munitions factories practically ate it up by the ton.I prefer more evocative prose and this language left me a little 'meh' on both the story and the character, but that's just me. I think it's still a good book about life on the home front and the hardships and heartbreaks the girls left behind had to endure.see all my reviews at www.tushuguan.blogspot.com",
            "Well, actually I'd give it a 31/2, but I can't seem to do that. This books is really interesting, the voice is authentic and refreshing, which makes sense because the author--well-known, often read in intermediate grades I think, is writing about something she lived through. The perspective is one I hadn't read about, important addition to the record! don't think it's written about much. But I also just read two really fast-paced, fun books, and this isn't either. I do like it though, and want it on the library shelf!",
            " The author drew on her own experiences as a teen during World War II to write this story of what it felt like to be one of the girls left behind. Mrs. Hunter succeeds in creating a feeling of immediacy for the reader.",
            "Yes-- this is the book to read if you're looking to acquaint yourself with the wartime era. ",
            "It was nice to see WWII from a different country's perspective. It's not that different from the U.S., but still an interesting idea.",

            "The book The Girls They Left Behind written by Bernice Thurman Hunter was a pretty good book. I only rated it a 3 because it was interesting but i didn't like it so much. The parts i liked about the book was that is was all about Natalie's life and now after the guys and her friends left when they went to war how it effected her and her girlfriends. Natalie didn't think it was far of how the guys got to go off to war and the girls just got to stay home and had to take care of everything and just sit there and worry about the husbands/brothers/fathers fighting and risking their lives. Natalie felt like she couldn't so anything so she decided to plan to move and change her name to Beryl because of how helpless she felt. The insights the book brought to the historical events covered was World War II and how when the men left that the woman took over all the jobs and then how worried the families were when some men came back but some didn't. Some information that was giving that the history textbooks wouldn't be able to be more information on how the girls and women felt after the war was started. Shares more what they have to go through instead of only talking about the men and what injuries they got and diseases. A little truth about life or pearl of wisdom that most grabbed my attention in the book was how sad it was after you got a note home saying that these people wouldn't be coming home or seeing the reaction and how it effected the family members. The thing that affected me and that also affects me is losing family and the emotion put into the book for the readers. A point that i liked about the book and that would be the three stars would be I liked how it was put into Natalie's perspective and also of how it affected her life even though she wasn't fighting. Another thing was feeling. Its always good when there is meaning life feeling and you can feel it through the book as you read which gets you to connect with it and really get into it. "

            "Augustus had a long and successful life as the emperor of Rome. Which was no small task. The Roman Republic was a government headed by 2 leaders and a complex system of checks and balances that had become intolerably corrupt and dysfunctional. It was a story of the Optimates, who favored the rich, and the Populares, who were rich themselves, but believed in spreading the wealth rather than hoarding it amongst themselves (is any of this sounding familiar?). There was significant conflict between these two, a fair amount of fighting, and ultimately the Optimates found Caesar so threatening that they banished him from Rome in 44 BC. Big mistake. The most successful general and leader of men in the history of Rome, who still had a standing army was told to disband his men and live in exile. That, as we know, did not go well for them. It went so badly that when Caesar crossed the Rubicon, meaning he defied the order the senate had given to him, the supposed defenders of Rome left. Caesar won the war, but was later assassinated by Optimates.In steps Augustus, then known as Octavian. He was the 18 year old nephew of Caesar and not a battle hardened warrior. He was clever and politically savvy, and he had a life long faithful companion who was a brilliant general. Augustus managed to take Rome into peace after it had been at war with itself for over a 100 years. Before he died he wanted his accomplishments recorded and he wanted his mistakes forgotten, so he wrote what was short for a work of writing, but long for an inscription, the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, and had it inscribed on his mausoleum and on monuments across the Roman empire. Remarkable, and not too long a read.",
            "As an example of how to present an edition of a text, this version of the Res Gestae definitely deserves five stars. There is a good introduction, the most thorough commentary (mostly historical) that you could ever, ever want, and the text itself is presented with Latin/English on the verso and Greek/English on the recto. Ah, the joys of bilingual inscriptions. You too can wonder why it is that all the numbers are given in sesterces in Latin and denarii in Greek. (Maybe the commentary answers this. I didn't look.)I am taking away a star just for my personal impression of the text itself, which is that Augustus was kind of a power-hungry jerk who was not as humble as he was trying to come across. (You can tell I'm not actually a classicist, can't you? Hey, no one ever said these Goodreads reviews had to be objective.) On the other hand, he really does seem to have brought peace and done a lot of amazing things for Rome, and it's really neat to have something that purports to be by him and is an account of his reign. Hooray, primary sources!Anyway. If you want to read the Res Gestae, get this edition. You probably already own it.",
            "Eine sch\u00f6ne Ausgabe, die auch den Text der griechischen Monumente vollst\u00e4ndig bietet. Der Stellenkommentar und die Belegstellen aus anderen Texten (v.a. Sueton und Cassius Dio, aber auch andere) sind sehr sorgf\u00e4ltig und erhellend. An manchen Stellen wirken die Erkl\u00e4rungen des Herausgebers sehr unkritisch und grenzen an Panegyrik.",
            "Res Gestae, ou Os Feitos do Divino Augusto \u00e9 uma breve enumera\u00e7\u00e3o feita pelo pr\u00f3prio imperador Augusto dos feitos que realizou durante seu reinado, que durou de 27 a.C. a 14 d.C. Essa lista de feitos, com 35 itens, foi escrita com objetivo de ser reproduzida nas colunas da entrada do mausol\u00e9u constru\u00eddo por Augusto, em que deveria ser colocado ap\u00f3s sua morte. O mausol\u00e9u ainda existe, mas as inscri\u00e7\u00f5es na coluna n\u00e3o s\u00e3o mais vis\u00edveis. Ainda assim, o texto serve para mostrar, mesmo se os evento relatados forem exagerados ou falsos, como Augusto via a si mesmo, ou pelo menos como queria ser visto depois que morresse.Como poderia se esperar, o texto \u00e9 cheio de primeira pessoa, linguagem que enaltece as a\u00e7\u00f5es de Augusto, e poucas men\u00e7\u00f5es aos outros grandes causadores do sucesso que Augusto acabou aproveitando sozinho, como Marco Ant\u00f4nio e at\u00e9 Julio C\u00e9sar, citado apenas indiretamente. Mas surpreende que tudo o que est\u00e1 escrito mostra um Augusto em servi\u00e7o do senado e do povo, recusando premia\u00e7\u00f5es, cargos e principalmente o cargo oficial de ditador. Ele admite, no final do texto, que era o romano mais influente, mas insiste n\u00e3o ter tido mais poder que seu companheiros c\u00f4nsules, se posiciona abaixo tanto do senado enquanto institui\u00e7\u00e3o quanto do pr\u00f3prio povo, cuja soberania e gl\u00f3ria alega ter sido o alvo de todos os seus esfor\u00e7os.Sabe-se, apesar disso, que Augusto quis sim o poder que recebeu e do qual usufruiu a partir da morte de Julio C\u00e9sar, for\u00e7ou as guerras que alega terem sido para a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do povo romano de fac\u00e7\u00f5es",
            "Keiser Augustus' egen fortelling om hans egne bragder, er et mesterstykke av politisk propaganda og bevisst bruk av retoriske virkemidler; ingenting overlates til tilfeldighetene. Hilde Brendeford Andreassen gj\u00f8r ogs\u00e5 en god jobb gjennom fotnotene \u00e5 korrigere de faktiske feilene og overdrivelsene som ble gjort av Augustus for \u00e5 fremstille seg selv i et annet og bedre lys."

        "description": "Love Actually is the highly awaited new screenplay and directorial debut from phenomenally popular screenwriter Richard Curtis. Weaving together the stories of ten couples, the movie is as real as our own lives, and as funny, wise, and poignant as only Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral) could create.Set in contemporary London just before Christmas, the cast includes a lovelorn Prime Minister, an aging rock star, a sexually ambitious assistant, a newly widowed stepfather, a beautiful housekeeper, a straying husband, and other characters entangled in the silly, sloppy, sexy, sweet business of finding love. The film's stellar actors include Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, and others.Introduced by Richard Curtis, the book features the full screenplay plus outtakes, behind-the-scenes snapshots, and more. With marvelous full-color photographs throughout, this smart, funny, romantic book is a valentine for anyone who still believes that despite the madness and uncertainty of modern life, love actually is all around.",

            "Love Actually, written and directed by Richard Curtis\tJust consider the cast:Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton, Rowan Atkinson and more.All the actors aforementioned are leading role stars.Indeed, there are interconnected stories in Love Actually that all have about the same weight in the mosaic.The point is plainly expressed in the introductory scene where the voice over suggests we should go to an airport.It sounds preposterous and indeed quite a few moments in this film are, but at an airport one can seeLove ActuallyBarbara Fredrikson is the ultimate expert on positivity and she has identified the ingredients in her book:PositivityThese are: amusement watch comedies, even silly ones like Love Actually- interest, awe, inspiration, hope, gratitude, serenity, joy, pride and the element that is towering over them all is:Love!There are some good moments in Love Actually, although this viewer had expected more from such a terrific cast.Maybe the best, included in the promos for good reason has the Prime Minister aka Hugh Grant\u2026dancing.Granted, this type of leader would never get office, for the large numbers of British would rather have a later day\u2026communist in the person of the unlikeable, admirer of Hugo Chavez and others like him, the rather stupid Jeremy Corbin- I have lived in a communist regime and understand what this politician preaches.The other moments that were charming involve two actors that perform in erotic fare and have to maintain a serious face throughout, even when he is told to massage her breasts and they talk about the\u2026traffic.Another amusing and repellent scene has Emma Thompson as the wife who finds a precious necklace in her husband\u2019s clothes and is very excited, thinking this is the present she gets for Christmas.However, when the gifts are presented, she opens her present only to find a \u2026music CD that demolishes her.The late Alan Rickman as the husband has bought that for another woman and this is causing a breakdown.The splendid Bill Nighy has a more relaxed attitude in the role of a singer who has some outrageous positions.During a live show, he says the right thing- teenagers; do not buy drugs- only to add: become singers and then you will get them free.This performer has a song in a competition that he is unlikely to win and promises that, if he does win, he will go naked on live TV.And he wins\u2026Collin Firth plays a charming- what else? - Writer who has a Portuguese-speaking house cleaner in a wonderful setting.One day, almost all the pages of his manuscript are blown away by the wind and the beautiful girl takes her clothes off\u2026well, most of them\u2026and jumps into the lake to get the novel.The writer falls in love with the woman who does not speak his language and he starts learning\u2026Portuguese.If farfetched and rather ridiculous, Colin Firth has the appeal to make the love scene in the restaurant somewhat plausible, even if the whole family and half of Lisbon appear to attend.The conclusion is that there are episodes that you might enjoy in this film and others that will have you cry\u2026Oh, come on\u2026give me a break!",

            "Dit boek was een verrassing van mijn moeder. Ik wist niet eens dat het boek bestond, hoewel Love Actually misschien wel mijn lievelingsfilm is. Zij kwam het echter tegen in een tweedehands winkel en had zo'n vermoeden dat ik er wel blij mee zou zijn. Ze had gelijk. Ik had vanochtend zin in iets Nederlands en iets luchtigs. Ik hoefde niet lang na te denken welk boek dat ging worden.Het boek is gebaseerd op de film en dat merk je. Het verhaal volgt letterlijk alle bekende scenes, en volgens mij ook nog wat scenes die de uiteindelijke film niet gehaald hebben. Plot technisch voegt het boek dan ook niet echt iets toe. Er zitten geen nieuwe personages of nieuwe verhaallijnen in. Als je de film al kan dromen, dan kan je het boek eigenlijk ook al dromen.Wat ik echter wel heel leuk vond, is dat de innerlijke emoties van de karakters in dit boek uitgeschreven worden. Natuurlijk, de acteurs kunnen veel duidelijk maken, maar niet alles en non verbale communicatie blijft toch lastig. Vooral de innerlijke gedachten van David zijn echt geweldig en ook in het boek waren Aurelia en Jamie mijn favorieten. Hun innerlijke gedachtes en gevoelens, de manier waarop ze voor elkaar vallen, het werkt op papier misschien nog wel beter dan op het scherm. Ook het verhaallijntje van Sarah en haar zieke broer komt net iets beter uit de verf op papier.Maar het allerbelangrijkste is dat dit boek me hetzelfde gevoel geeft als de film me geeft: Warmte, blijdschap en het idee dat er echt meer liefde op de wereld is dan al het andere. Het was het perfecte boek voor dit moment. Dus dankjewel mama dat je deze voor me hebt meegebracht!",

            "Me before reading The Burning Bridge: Oh my gosh I'm so excited to read this, ugh but I have other books to read but Im going to abandon those for this one because I miss Will's adventures. Me immediately after reading The Burning Bridge: OH MY FUDGE GOSH WHAT? NO WTH THERE HAS TO BE MORE THERE HAS TO BE MORE AHHHHHHHHHHHH *scream that lasts for 10 minutes then slowly transfers into sobs* NO NO NO NO I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE END AHHHHHHHHHHHH IT CAN'T END LIKE THIS MACARONI NOT FAIR NOT FAIR!!!!! I am honestly at a loss for words except for WHAT THE IN THE NAME OF KING DUNCAN JUST HAPPENED? Honestly THEE most torturing CLIFFIE in history of books. I am seething. Ugh this is so BLAHI will go get a snack and do a proper review after I gather my thoughts and mop up the sea of tears that have splattered my floor. If you'll excuse me *sniff sniff*.................Okay I have returned more emotionally stable.So this is the 2nd(epic) installment in the Ranger's Apprentice series by Mr Flanagan. I have to say I like this sequel better than the 1st. Don't get me wrong though, the 1st is incredible as well. But there's a lot more action in this one and Gilan got a bigger role in it. I can't really explain the plot without giving several things away so I'll just say that the Kingdom is preparing for a vicious war against Morgarath (Evil bad guy) and Will, Horace, and Gilan must stop his treacherous plans. Along the way they encounter everything from Wargals (creatures that work for Morgarath) Skandians(actually pretty chill group of men but also working for Morgarath) and a girl who goes by the name Evanlyn. The writing was very good, detailed but not repetitive. I loved everything about the book. The characters were all extremely likable except for the bad guys of course. I was actually really scared for them when they were left alone (won't tell you who but the point is I felt emotion and general attachment to the characters) The ending I knew was coming because of the title of the next one in the series but I refused to believe it until I was on page 262 even then staring dumb-fonded as I refused to believe it could end like that. Ughh I hate cliffiessssss. I'm dying to read the next one ASAP! Highly recommend the whole series to everyone and I haven't even read all of them yet. Hehe really good book though, 5 well-deserved stars!",
            "The burning bridge (Ranger's Apprentice #2), John Flanagan The Burning Bridge is the second book of the Ranger's Apprentice series written by Australian author John Flanagan. It was released in Australia on 5 May 2005. On a special mission for the Ranger Corps, Will, his friend Horace, and the Ranger Gilan travel to Celtica, a neighbouring country to Araluen. They discover that all the people have vanished. Will and Horace wonder if all the villagers have been slain or captured, but Gilan believes that the evil Lord Morgarath devised a plan to cross the mountain pass faster. If that were true, and the King wasn't warned, the country would be destroyed. Gilan rides to warn King Duncan, and Will and Horace begin to follow a straggling Wargal force. On their way, they come across a girl named Evanlyn, who claims to be a maid to a lady of the Araluan court, but is actually the Princess herself. When the three of them follow the dimwitted Wargals they discover that a gargantuan bridge is in the process of being built across The impassable Fissure for their war party to cross. They also discover that the King's army will be trapped on the Plains of Uthal, because the plans that Halt captured were merely a ruse. Will burns the bridge with Evanlyn's help. Evanlyn tries to warn Will about a rock thrown by a Skandian but is too late giving a chance for a Skandian to grab them. Will and Evanlyn are taken captive by the group of Skandians ruled by Jarl Erak. Fortunately, Horace was able to escape their grasp. After, he tells the King and his aides about what is going to happen, the army starts to get prepared for the army that is supposed to attack them from behind, Halt is sent to take care of them with a force of cavalry and archer units (an archer and pikeman). In the middle of the battle, Morgarath calls a truce and challenges Halt to a duel, but king Duncan forbids it. Then, unexpectedly, Horace challenges Morgarath to single combat. About to be defeated by Morgarath, Horace then, in a last-ditch attempt to win the battle, throws himself into the path of the battlehorse, to throw it off-balance. He is successful, but only manages to wind Morgarath. Morgarath is confident that he is going to win by a last powerful stroke of his broadsword, but Horace blocks it with the double-knife defence that Gilan taught Will and stabs Morgarath to win the battle. The Wargals become harmless as soon as Morgarath dies and the mind domination is broken. Immediately Halt goes looking for Will and Cassandra but fails and so the Skandians escape to Skandia to sell Will and Princess Cassandra as slaves.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0698\u0627\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2013 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u062a\u0634\u06cc\u0646 - \u062c\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u0645\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0646\u062a\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646 (\u0641\u0644\u0646\u0627\u06af\u0627\u0646)\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0641\u0642\u060c 1391\u061b \u062f\u0631 423 \u0635\u061b \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 2\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643698072\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645\u067e\u0644 \u0622\u062a\u0634\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u06af\u0631\u062f \u0631\u0646\u062c\u0631 (\u062c\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646) \u0627\u062b\u0631: \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0646\u062a\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u0644\u0646\u06af\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f. \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0631 5 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u0644 2005 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0631 \u0634\u062f. \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0647: \u067e\u0627\u0646\u0632\u062f\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0647\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0626\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0635\u0644\u062d \u0648 \u0635\u0641\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06af\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u06af\u0630\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0648\u0647\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0638\u0644\u0645\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u062f. \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u062f\u0633\u06cc\u0633\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u06af\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0648\u06cc\u0644 \u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0634 \u0647\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u06a9\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u06af\u062c\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062a \u0648\u06cc\u0698\u0647\u200c \u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0633\u0627\u06cc\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f. \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0647\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u06cc\u0644 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0634\u062f\u0647\u200c \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc",
            "WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS SUPER RAMBLY AND PROBABLY NOT THAT GREATBurning Bridge is the second book in The Ranger's Apprentice series. It really picks up from where book one finishes, continuing to follow the story of the characters we were introduced to and following a few more. Whereas the first book can be seen as boring for 80% of the book, The Burning Bridge has a lot more plot for the reader to immerse themselves in. When I first read this book in 2010 I remember not being able to put it down, staying up late by using my lamp and covering the cracks of my door with jumpers so no one would know - obviously I was a big rebel. The Burning Bridge focuses primarily on Will, Gilan and Horace. They are on a quest, so to say, to visit the Celtics in order to provide information about an upcoming war. However, upon arrival it is obvious something is amiss. The Celtics, who are stated to be clean people, have left watch bases abandoned and not in the standard they would. The trio continue further into villages to find more or less the same thing only to learn they have been outsmarted. Basically the plot line, so much more happens that I don't want to mention due to spoilers as well. CharactersWith characters we get so many perspectives I can't really focus on certain primary characters in order to fill this section of my review. What is needed to know is we get humour from each perspective. As well as gaining insights between the trio and Halt back at the castle where he seems to be throwing Lords in moats. World-BuildingThe world building wasn't as vital or obvious in this book, since so much had been established in the previous book. It was still present however with how the author described the characters and added a slight magical twist to it all. It was alluring in the sense it is both historical and fanatical. OverallOverall, this review is incredibly scattered but I woke up at 5am so I'm giving myself a break personally. I enjoyed this book immensely. Seeing Alyss and Halt interact was hilarious, as well was finding out about him and Lady Pauline. I absolutely adore the characters of this series and would, without a doubt, recommend it to people who are unsure if they should pick it up. It's worth the read. I'll find you",
            "Really, if I could give 6 stars, this series would get them. They are so good. I love the characters, good and bad, and the way we are seeing them grow up or older. There is so much action and adventure, very much like Lord of the Rings. Love these books.",
            "Wow! I loved this book. While the first book in the series was good, this one was great. There was more action, more humor, a good battle, and a fantastic cliffhanger at the end. Enjoy!",
            "What an amazing sequel!! Also Will.... you just can't do this to me!!",
            "Jo\u0161 uvek nekako naivno ali ipak pri\u010da kajo dr\u017ei pa\u017enju i koja se ve\u0107 bavi malo te\u017eim temama.

            "Even under Halt's tutelage, years of training will be needed for Will to become a Ranger. In this era of war, though, he'll only have months before being required to perform like one. It seems to be an important victory when Halt and Will ambush a small party of Wargals, slaying the violent creatures and discovering a written plan for Lord Morgarath's next siege against the Kingdom of Araluen. Morgarath was banished fifteen years ago for exerting mind control over the Wargals and using them to attack Araluen, but Halt turned the tide of battle against Morgarath at the eleventh hour. Foreknowledge of the evil lord's plans will be key in stopping his assault on the kingdom's fifty fiefs a second time. It could be Araluen's saving grace...if the plans are authentic. A reconnaissance mission to Celtic lands is necessary to warn the people, but Halt is needed elsewhere. So Gilan\u2014Halt's first apprentice, a master swordsman and tracker\u2014heads the mission, joined by Will and Horace, a Battleschool apprentice whose childhood rivalry with Will resolved itself in book one, The Ruins of Gorlan. In Celtica they find deserted villages and homes that appear to have been vacated some time ago. Why did the Celts disappear without notifying anyone? Gilan, Will, and Horace's worst suspicions are confirmed when they meet Evanlyn, a frightened teen girl who says that Wargals raided the region and killed her companions. Morgarath's push for war with Araluen is escalating rapidly, but his actions don't match the written plans that Halt and Will found. What is the Lord of Rain and Night's real strategy, and what are mere feint tactics to deceive Araluen's braintrust? Observing how Halt misses having Will around, Baron Arald and Lady Pauline of Castle Redmont temporarily assign young Alyss to him. The apprentice ambassador enlivens the Ranger's daily life, but Halt is concerned for Will out in the countryside where deadly enemies roam. Will struggled in his most recent combat with the aggressive Wargals; if they meet again, can Gilan coach him to win the fight and restore Will's confidence? Gilan is the team leader, but Will and Horace are capable apprentices and Evanlyn is a keen strategist, and they deduce that Morgarath has a hidden design for Araluen's destruction. His vast Wargal army is bottled up on the wrong side of a mountain pass, unable to invade the kingdom in large numbers, but Morgarath has devised a solution to the problem. There's no time to head home and alert King Duncan, but a bold gambit by Will, Horace, and Evanlyn could shut down Morgarath's path and allow opportunity for Araluen to shore up its vulnerabilities. The time is now for Will to act as a Ranger and Horace a knight, but can two apprentices and a plucky friend actually defeat the dark lord who has tormented Araluen since before any of them were born? Will couldn't have a better mentor than Halt. Will had nascent Ranger abilities and a good heart, but needed Halt to show him what separates a real warrior from the romanticized version in most people's minds. Will and Halt spend most of The Burning Bridge apart, so we miss out on this continuing education, but there are a few bright spots of wisdom. Will recalls Halt's advice while he's scouting an empty tract of land. Whenever you're scouting...move as if there's somebody there to see you. Never assume that you're on your own. Peril is ever-present when you're taking sensitive action. Why risk your life if a bit of discipline can shield you from disaster? Halt treated Will with indifference for most of the first book",
            "The author\u2019s command of the language allows the continuation of the story of The Ranger's Apprentice to flow with ease and familiarity. Characters become those you care about, nervous and anxious when they are in danger and happy and satisfied when a job is well-done. The on-going story starts with the The Ruins of Gorlan and your memory is refreshed in such a way that it is not merely rehashing and reiterating the beginning over again , but a gentle reminder of what proceeded at the start of the saga. Halt, and his apprentice Ranger, Will are continuing their training of the ranger method, as Horace, Will's orphanage mate, is training on the battleschool field. The first inklings of an invasion by evil and sadistic Morgarath and his Wargals is becoming apparent. Gilan, a trusted fellow ranger, was the first ranger trained by Halt.He is sent on a mission with Will and Horace to enlist the help of the secretive Celtica nation, a nation known for their mastery of mining, welding and tunnel excavations. When passing through many towns in Celtica, an ominous foreboding is surrounding the towns\u2026they are virtually empty of life and it is evident that they have left their homes in haste. What happened to them? Why does Gilan, Halt and Horace sense that it has something to do with Morgarath? An adventure story, touched ever-so-slightly by fantasy elements, is filled with battle strategy and maneuvers,strong yet compassionate men, no-good, money loving mercenaries and intelligent and beautiful women. The Wargals, half-men half-bearlike creatures are controlled by Morgarath. Their brute force is unmatched, yet their every move is controlled through the brain-washing effects dictated by Morgarath. Will, Horace, Gilan and Halt combine efforts to aid King Duncan of Araluen in the defeat of Morgarath. Will, Horace, Halt and Gilan , along with newcomer Evanlyn (Cassandra)all contribute to Morgarath's demise, but the story does not end conveniently, as Will and Evanlyn, seemed doomed to a life of slavery with their capture by the Skandias. Will Halt let that happen? I assume we will all find out in the third book of the series. ",
            "This book is very well written, not only grammatically, but in the emotion that the author can draw out of the reader. The story plot line is exceptional, and creates a world you can truly believe exists. This atmosphere in the book is so realistic, you become immersed in the world inside the book. The book is actually the second in a series. However, in the first two pages it explains the background, and then dives right in, not wasting time on lengthy unnecessary explanations. The story begins in an exciting manner, with a chase, a capture of battle plans, and the beginning of a war. The story continues, growing in excitement, and subterfuge. Though the plot thickens, it does not become over complicated and it creates an almost perfect balance of characters, emotions and plot lines. Everything that happens to the characters pulls at you, compelling you to feel what they feel.This book is excellently written and I would recommend it for anyone at any age. It is a book that many, no matter what age will find enjoyable to read.I loved reading this book because this book created one of the most realistic worlds I have encountered in a book. This book also balanced all of the elements, ensuring I wouldn't get confused, while also adding depth.",
            "So far, I am really enjoying this series.",
            "Gosh I love having a new fantasy YA series to read!",
            "OKAY THIS SERIES IS JUST SO MUCH FUN. It feels like a classic, with clear lines drawn between good and evil, spunky, vibrant characters, and a lot of heart. Flanagan writes about this fantastical world realistically-- I felt like I learned a lot about strategy and fighting and survival. Super cool. My eyes got really big reading the last couple of chapters and surprising me is always a good thing.",
            "These books are just so enjoyable and the narrator is amazing. The characters are well constructed and so is the story and the world that has been created. This ones ends with kind of a cliff hanger so if you want to know what happens you have no choice but to read book 3.",
            "Loved it! That ending was very frantic and fast-paced, and had me on the edge of my seat.Definitely feeling hooked on this series. 2 down, 10 to go! ",
            "This book was pretty interesting. It all started in the kingdom of Aularan where all good rangers are which Will a seventeen years old is one of the rangers. And theirs the Morgarath which is the evil one. So what happened is that Will and the other rangers found something strange which the evil Morgarath doesn't attack often in the Aularan kingdom anymore. Then the rangers decides to sneak in to the Mirgarath. And they see that their preparing an attack. One thing I liked about the book was the fighting. One thing I didn't liked about book was theirs always one important character that dies.",
            "This review originally published in Phantases and Other Funny WordsNote: Below, my review is split into two parts. The first gives my general thoughts on the book, and the second details spoilers and major plot points. Be warned.Part One: OverviewMuch of what I said about the previous book applies to The Burning Bridge as well. The characters, yet again, are developed on a very basic level. The world is hardly expanded, and even the new things we learn about Araluen and its surroundings are based so heavily on the real world that they\u2019re hardly new information.Morgarath, whose name should have told anyone who ever met him that he was evil, is not much of a threatening villain. While he does pose a threat to the main characters and to the kingdom of Araluen, he\u2019s not exactly memorable or interesting. He is, simply put, an obstacle to be overcome.However, I had fun reading The Burning Bridge. It\u2019s another adventure with very simple but passable characters. This time Will and Horace are together for most of the book, and that allows the reader to notice their budding friendship. It\u2019s not as iconic as that of, say, Sherlock and Watson, or Frodo and Sam, but there is potential in the way the characters are written. The battle scenes were written with great attention placed to the strategies of the armies. This did get a little tiresome after the eight or nine of nothing but battle, but it is still impressive how far Flanagan went to make his battles feel realistic, planned out and intelligent. Overall, an enjoyable read. I\u2019ll continue reading the Ranger\u2019s Apprentice series to see where it goes.Part Two: OverviewThe only major problem I had with the second entry in the series was that only three events of major importance happen in the entire book: Celtica is invaded, the titular bridge is burned and Will is captured by Skandian mercenaries. Quite frankly, these details could have likely all been covered in the first book. The Burning Bridge ends with the final battle against Morgarath, so thematically, this book could have been coupled with the first one to make a single, cohesive novel. As it stands, it\u2019s not bad at all, but it is a little slow and does drag at times, especially in the scenes where the characters have little or nothing to do except sit around and talk to each other.The reveal of Evanlyn not being who she says she is was a little transparent. However, it\u2019s maybe excusable because the author never pretends that this is some grand mystery. From the moment that Evanlyn/Cassandra is introduced, she shows hints of not being who she says she is, and even the characters draw attention to this. It\u2019s not so much a mystery for us, the readers, as it is for the characters themselves. I, for one, am glad that we\u2019re done with Morgarath. He wasn\u2019t very well built-up as a force to be reckoned with or even as a decent antagonist. As I already mentioned, he was but an obstacle for the main characters. I hope that the next books are less conventional, with more twists and turns to the plot than what The Burning Bridge gave us. It was a small-scale adventure that advanced the overall narrative only marginally, and which culminated with a grand battle.",

            "So, book number 2 in this series and I must say that I enjoyed this just as much as book 1 which was a pleasant surprise. I really loved book 1 for the wonderful characters and the charming storytelling. I felt that there were good messages about friendship and trust and I would say that those themes have been strongly carried into book 2 as well. I particularly enjoyed getting to see more of Gilan\u2019s personality and seeing the way that he led the younger characters was interesting and fun. I did miss having Halt around, but I feel that he\u2019ll certainly come into play more in book 3\u2026This story is again following the adventures of young Will and Horace who are both wonderfully sarcastic, innocent and yet truly courageous and heroic characters. They have all the enthusiasm of young kids, but they also have strong senses of duty and honour and they know what is required of them by the King.They face a fair few trials and problems in this storyline but they are resourceful and innovative and they make a good team. I really enjoy hearing about their adventures and I hope that the series continues in a similar way to how it\u2019s currently being told. I am very much looking forward to book 3 after the cliff-hanger ending and I really want to see more about Will and Evenlyn\u2019s relationship as they face what lies ahead. I feel like they will have to rely on one another and I hope that we\u2019ll see a natural progression from acquaintances to friends.I would highly recommend this series as a children\u2019s series. If you love adventure stories then this is a great, fast-paced and fun read and I think well-deserving of 4*s :)",
            "The Burning Bridge was a fantastic sequel in the Ranger's Apprentice series. It was just as good, if not better, than the first book. I think the fact that there the characters and setting had previously been introduced, allowed the story to advance with more ease. The storyline was engaging. The characters were fantastic - it certainly increased my affection for Gilan and Horace. I loved the dramatic ending but I am a little nervous about where it will take the story in The Icebound Land."

        "description": "American author THOMAS WILLIAM DOANE (1852-1885) is considered one of the most significant contributors to the Freethought movement, which held the view that belief should be based on the epistemology of scientific and logical laws, rather than on faith. In support of this philosophy, Doane undertook extensive research delving into the parallels between Christianity and preexisting religions from around the world, ultimately meaning to show the difference between eternal truths, both spiritual and scientific, and fable. Here, in a work first published in 1882, he takes a methodical stroll through each of the most popular Biblical myths from both the Old and New Testaments, including the Flood, the Exodus, Samson, the Star of Bethlehem, baptism, and the temptation of Christ. By providing copious evidence of the preexistence of the morals and indeed, associated details of each, as well as thorough bibliographic information, the fruit of Doane's labor is a fascinating survey of world religions and a compelling critique of the originality of Christian dogma.",

            "Written in 1882 and revised in 1910, it is still relevant. While there are some are some areas where further data has put some of his statements into question, the majority have only confirmed and strengthened his argument, that while real Jesus may have existed, the stories in the Bible about his life are pure myth, copied from the myths of other religions. Typical of many books written in the nineteenth century it is often wordy, tedious and repetitious. Having said that there are other areas that are clear, concise and poetic prose. Another book that is well worth having, if for no other reason for the references he gives, many of which are neglected by modern scholars. Also, it gives a good history of how long the idea of the mythological nature of the Jesus in the New Testament has been noted and reported on. From the earliest days of Christianity to the present this tome is full of epistles, letters and writings showing how often and by how many early authorities have known that the Gospels were mythological in origin and the true Jesus would not recognize himself in the gospels if he could read them.",
            "In The Spirit Of Campbell and JungWritten a century or more ago, the book is a look at the similarities between religions and mythologies - focusing on the Judeo-Christian comparison to other regions and religious traditions. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here - all of it solidly cited, researched and cross referenced. The premise of the author is that modern Christianity is an amalgam of multiple historical legends with little archaeological or contemporary support. A compelling and interesting read. ",
            "Inconsistent historical information, Questionable comparisons. ",
            "Wow...I got to page 111 and practically skimmed the 600 page book. It was hard to read due to the file format of when it was uploaded. The book talks about stories in the Bible then compares them to myths that are similar. It\u2019s impossible to zoom in to the small fine print. You can make out the words in the document but this one is really old. Written in the late 1800s or something like that from an unpopular writer of that era. This is a book that will challenge your faith. Can you still believe in a God knowing that the story was copied?There seems to be some sort of pattern that I\u2019ve noticed. Stories copying others and adding to them. For example, Dracula the vampire drinks human blood and then twilight where the vampire drinks animal blood. That is how I see this book from my perspective. It\u2019s one that tells you religion is a story and has been. To take that story and make it a religion took a lot of convincing that it\u2019s my way or the highway. ",
            "Considering the time when it was published (1882) this is probably one of the most comprehensive compilations of parallel beliefs and myths between the ancient pagan religions and the Abrahamic ones (that I have read). Whether it was proven or not, within the limited scope of our knowledge it all made us deeply think about each similarity and how we twist truths and traditions in accordance with our desires to maintain power and influence. 4 stars for the Sun God the OG",
            "It's eye-opening but it's kind of all over the place. I needed a more linear structured presentation of comparative religious stories to be able to connect the dots than what this book provided. "

            "Hmmm. I struggled with this a bit because I generally adore Joanne Harris. This is her lost second novel",
            "\u2018Sleep Pale Sister\u2019 is an early Joanne Harris novel and has a slightly unformed feeling in comparison to, say, Chocolat. It is a ghostly gothic melodrama, chiefly notable to my mind for the variations in character awareness of this. The two male narrators sometimes comment wryly that their lives resemble a gothic novel; at other times they forget it and are filled with such uncontrollable dread that they knock back laudanum until the situation improves. One of the female narrators, meanwhile, is the one turning all those depicted into players in a ghostly gothic melodrama. To my mind she was by far the most interesting character, perhaps because she remained the most mysterious. The titular pale sister, Effie, was largely a pawn and thus pitiful. Both leading men, however, were absolutely hateful. Their cavalier attitude can be summed up as, \u2018Well I wouldn\u2019t say that murdering women was a hobby of mine, but it\u2019s bound to happen now and again isn\u2019t it.\u2019 The atmosphere of the whole thing is certainly oppressive, although I wouldn\u2019t call it frightening. The relatively slow pacing creates definite tension and I was intrigued to see how events would play out. Nonetheless, the inconsistent level of self-consciousness within the narrative prevented me from being swept away by it. While it does not read as a pastiche of gothic melodrama, with a few changes I think it could have. Perhaps that would have worked better for me? As it was, I liked the imagery and theme of the Furies (as well as the cats named after them!), yet found myself observing the characters more dispassionately than I\u2019d expect for such a melodramatic book.",
            "This was actually the first of Joanne Harris' books that I've read, which strikes me as odd since I consider myself a fan. But I realized that that fan status is based solely on the viewing of the movie Chocolat (Johnny Depp",
            "Bought this book because the title sounded intriguing, and there was a promise of some of the story being set in a brothel. The beginning was really good, but then it became more and more predictable, then mystical in a very cheap way, and then simply boring. At one point I started to wonder if and how anything was going to happen, because the story seemed to be so close to the end, and there were still over 100 pages remaining.It tried very hard to be a VERY Gothic novel (the word Gothic was frequently repeated)",
            "Sleep, Pale Sister / 9780061843181Sleep",
            "This book fit squarely into my super-love category. Mysterious, sensual, provocative, magical. On the cover a reviewer calls this book a hauntingly evocative laudanum-dream of a novel and I must say I agree completely. I have not read any of Ms. Harris's other books and I hesitate to",
            "One of Joanne's first and 'lost' books which entices, shocks and lulls you into it's gripping clutches.Told in the different voices of the main characters we unravel the story of Henry Chester who has dark hidden secrets and his lovely, young wife Effie as they become seduced by dark shadowy characters and drugs into a world of blackmail and intrigue.Madness plays a big part in this novel, whether it has its roots in drugs, temperament, grief, lust or superstition but we definately see a spiral into a dark and dependant world by both Henry and Effie. It's quite a page turner even though there is no amibiguity about the ending, as the story goes on the reader knows what will happen but it's no less compelling or chilling for that and it leaves a certain sense of sadness behind for poor Effie. I really enjoyed it as Joanne Harris does have a way of getting into your head and making you question the characters.If you have read A Fearful Symmetry by Audrey Nieffergegger you will find a lot of similarities with the ghost theme and cemetries and ...well, I don't want to give the story away, but if you enjoyed one you'll probably enjoy the other!",
            "\u201cSleep, Pale Sister\u201d is a campy gothic novel that ultimately suffers in its attempts to comingle too many themes that individually merited more serious development. We are introduced to uptight artist Henry Chester whose young ward Effie is groomed as his model until at 17, she is married to her much older benefactor. While Henry espouses puritanically repressed attitudes of sexuality, ostensibly meant to maintain Effie\u2019s purity, his weekly sojourns to a nearby brothel reveal his hypocrisy and debauched desires. As he furthers attempts to suppress his bride\u2019s budding sexuality using threats prescribed by a smarmy psychoanalyst, she finds an outlet through the unsavory lothario Mose Harper. Although the plot at this point held promise, complications involving an alter ego figure of Effie became muddied as supernatural elements developed and destroyed the potential of her seductive darkness .The book does raise questions of Victorian society\u2019s cruelty in regard to treatment of children and the control men exerted over their wives fearing diagnosis of hysteria, overdosing with laudanum, or confinement in asylums. I just wish these had been handled with the usual restraint and mastery that Joanne Harris used in her more recent novels."

        "description": "For millennia, Buddhists have enjoyed the limitless benefits of meditation. But how does it work? And why? The principles behind this ancient practice have long eluded some of the best minds in modern science. Until now.In this groundbreaking work, world-renowned Buddhist teacher Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche invites us to join him in unlocking the secrets behind the practice of meditation. Working with neuroscientists at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, Yongey Mingyur provides clear insights into modern research indicating that systematic training in meditation can enhance activity in areas of the brain associated with happiness and compassion. He has also worked with physicists across the country to develop a fresh, scientifically based interpretation of the Buddhist understanding of the nature of reality.With an infectious joy and insatiable curiosity, Yongey Mingyur weaves together the principles of Tibetan Buddhism, neuroscience, and quantum physics in a way that will forever change the way we understand the human experience.Using the basic meditation practices he provides, we can discover paths through everyday problems, transforming obstacles into opportunities to recognize the unlimited potential of our own minds.With a foreword by bestselling author Daniel Goleman, The Joy of Living is a stunning breakthrough, an illuminating vision of the science of Buddhism and a handbook for transforming our minds, bodies, and lives.",

            "Buddhism is not a religion. To a trained Buddhist, it is a type of science",
            "There are probably as many books about meditation as there are meditators, so what makes this book different and why does it earn five stars?Mingyur Rinpoche is most unusual for many reasons, starting with his youth (b. 1975) and that he was already recognized as a Meditation Master while only a young teen. But he also has an insatiable curiosity and interest in Western studies in neurology, psychology, and philosophy, and he tries to synthesize what he learns with what he knows from his Buddhist tradition.The first part of the book is an explanation (perhaps oversimplified) of what the West knows about the brain and the elusive mind and how it related to meditation. The second part of the book is about meditation and the techniques used. And the final is kind of over to you to the reader",
            "Very insightful and helpful - it opened my eyes to the power of meditation. It is not a book about becoming a Buddhist, but more about how the human brain responds to meditation. If you're interested in how Buddhism and Western Neurobiology mirror each other, this is a great reference. The author describes his own experiences with significant anxiety growing up in Nepal, and shares how meditation helped him. The book also details his experience at the University of Wisconsin in the brain imaging department where he meditates in an MRI machine and shows his brain during meditation where scientists saw a 700 percent increase in certain brain centers. It was fascinating to see modern science prove something that Buddhists have been doing for thousands of years.  From the book jacket: A beautiful tapestry of Buddhist insight woven together with modern science",
            "This book was too many feel-good things at once. Pseudo-science meets religion justified by populist self-improving individualist crap equates to boring-ass writing. It took too long to read simply because it was so detestably practical I couldn't get myself to move through it. I don't care if he's a Rinpoche - he's catering to the all-consuming self-absorbed yuppy who would freak if you put milk in his/her latte but probably run you over with his/her Prius if you were jay-walking. He cited literature that was actually notably Buddhist (Words of My Perfect Teacher) and relatively known in psychiatry (A General Theory of Love) and many scientific studies but the writing felt like a watered down syndicate. I couldn't trust anything I read I felt like I had to double-check all of his notes.",
            "Some interesting parables here and good meditation techniques. I also enjoyed the author's references to Western science and research on meditation. Overall, though, not a lot of new material for me. Well written and engaging.",
            "Read this book casually, quietly and you will walk away with the clearest ideas about what makes you happy and how to practice happiness. It's really that simple.",
            "This book does several nifty things. First, it shows how concepts from Buddhism and contemporary scientific studies agree with each other. Then, it discusses some studies on people in meditation. It turns out that meditation, when done by people who have done it for a long time and are good at it, makes people incredibly happy and peaceful. (This isn't big news, but it's cool to hear how science has proven this.)Then, the book discusses meditation techniques with a level of detail and clarity that is unsurpassed in...well, in the five or six books on meditation that I've read. I'd never been given permission to meditate for two or three minutes before; I was always under the impression that meditation needed to be a half hour or so in order for it to be valid. According to Yongey, that's not true. The Joy of Living is a quick, easy to read book that's highly informative. If the subject matter interests you, I'd recommend it. "

            "Remember the days when you were a child, running around with apparently an unlimited supply of energy with our young minds jumping around from one thing to another to for an extended period of time one would think we never could focus on anything for an extended period of time. Yet, at the same time, our young minds absorbed things like a sponge.If we came from a Christian home, our young minds enthralled by the biblical stories we heard had been able to comprehend biblical teachings which our parents might have had a difficult time in comprehending since they\u2019ve probably forgotten what they\u2019d been taught as a child. According to scripture, you as a parent have commanded several times by the Lord to teach your children; and a few examples can be found be Deuteronomy 4:9-10, 6:7, Joshua 4:22, and Proverbs 22:6. And to do so is for the Lord should be looked as an honor to obey Him as you\u2019re answering the higher calling he\u2019s given you.However, the truth be said, many parents are unfortunately ill-equipped to adequately answer this calling which the Lord has given them, and must seek some guidance from a qualified mentor. Luckily for them there\u2019s Charles H, Spurgeon of Blessed Memory [1834-1892] who this book, which is still being published today with an updated, modern English text, and a testament to the worthiness of what the book has to offer well over a hundred years later.Come Ye Children, is also a testament for the Lord, for He too has taken under the task of promising to teach His children as well; and as proof, you just need to check out the scriptural word which can be found in Psalm 132:12, Isaiah 54:13, and Psalm 34:11.And although the author is no longer alive to see this, I\u2019ve given his book the 5 STARS this reviewer is giving this book today.",

It is addressed to parents and teachers, but that really means everyone. We all have contact with children and are teaching them something. This book will inspire you to think Biblically about children and about their need to be born again!",

This book has a separate Spanish language edition; I would have loved some Spanish in this English language story as well. In the illustrations I particularly loved the stars, in all the places they appeared.",
            "Absolutely gorgeous, luminous illustrations make this an outstanding book! The story is about Mother Sky who tries to get Little Night ready to play in the sky, but mischievous Little Night loves to hide. Wow, I loved it!",
            "Mother Sky gets her daughter ready for the nighttime in this lovely tale, chasing after and finding her, as she continually runs off to hide. Behind the hills, inside a bat's cave, in a blueberry field, Little Night finds plenty of places to conceal herself, but Mother Sky always manages to find her, eventually succeeding in bathing her (in falling stars), dressing her (in a dress crocheted from clouds), and untangling her hair (with a shiny comb). Now Little Night is ready to play with her Moon ball...An innovative recreation of the bedtime story, Yuyi Morales' Little Night imagines a mother preparing her child for nighttime play, rather than the more traditional sleep. The seek-and-find element of the tale, in which mother always finds her baby, will be quite familiar to picture-book readers, although it has a particularly magical feeling here. Just as magical, the artwork - with its deep, vivid colors, and humorous little details - will leave the reader enchanted! I loved the way Mother Sky's braids were constantly sticking out behind or above her, almost like antennae feeling for something. I loved Morales' dark, restful palette, so suitable for a nighttime story. And I loved the emotional attachment between mother and daughter, that is so evident in these illustrations. My favorite scene is probably the one, toward the end, in which Mother Sky fixes three hairpins - Venus, Mercury and Jupiter - in Little Night's hair. Just beautiful!",
            "Little Night and Mother Sky play hide-and-seek through the sunset.",
            "Wow, what a beautifully illustrated and engaging children's book!This is a fascinating short story about Mother Sky and Little Night, getting ready for the end of the day. It is very accessible for children because it depicts familiar activities of bath time, getting dressed, combing hair - all accompanied by the playful interaction of hide-and-seek as Little Night tries to delay each activity. What makes it special is how the illustrations show you these are all metaphors for the daylight ending and transitioning to nighttime. The colors and flowing lines are gorgeous on every page, and help to tell the story very well. Little Night has brightly glowing planets for hairpins, and plays with the full moon as if it were a ball. I don't know if most children will catch this, but Little Night is actually getting ready to stay up all night, because she is Night, after all. The cadence and progression of the book reads a lot like a bedtime book, which is useful for getting kids into the bedtime mood, even though the main character won't actually be going to sleep!Major kudos to the author for representing these protagonists as characters of color. The Little Night character was a very dark-skinned child with kinky hair - a much-needed representation as these attributes are rarely seen in popular children's books. Of course, her depiction flows naturally from the idea that the child is night",
            "Just when you thought i might have gone and tried to grow up on ya'all i have another wonderful picture book recommendation for everyone to check out: Little Night by Pura Belpre Award winning author and artist Yuyi Morales. Little Night begins at the end of the long day asMother Sky fills a tub with falling stars and calls, Bath time for Little Night!Little Night answers from afar",
            "This is a favorite of my newest daughter, who is desperate for books that show characters that look like her, i.e. little girls with brown skin. Every night she asks for this book and I am happy to oblige.This fact won't apply to many families out there, but book's flow and rhythm makes it easy to translate into Amharic, my daughter's language, which makes for a soothing bedtime read.Each page depicts a little girl, who is the night, hiding from her mother the sky. She wants to be found, but plays hard to get, all the while Mother and Daughter go through a bedtime routine that is enchanting and beautifully painted.We love Little Night's (or Tinish Mata in Amharic) dark dark skin, how her drink of milk from the Milky Way shows up on her upper lip. How her mama calls for hair time and Tinish Mata sits in her lap to have her hair twisted up.This is a book brown girls can relate to. The poetic prose is lovely, the word playing with nighttime and sky themes tying into a mother daughter relationships is brilliant. The world needs more books like this. ",
            "With soft, soothing colors and a whimsical story, I think this would be a perfect bedtime read. The Little Night character is adorably mischievous and the Mother Sky character is nurturing and playful. The story seems to end a bit abruptly, but otherwise it's a fun story to read aloud. We really enjoyed reading this book together. This book was selected as one of the books for the September 2013 - Bedtime stories discussion at the Picture-Book Club in the Children's Books Group here at Goodreads.",
            "Little night is both written and illustrated by Yuyi Morales. She is, in my opinion, one of the most talented illustrators. This story is beautifully illustrated in a range of blues and purples to depict the characters of the night. Mother Sky and her daughter Little night live, play and wonder the night sky. Little night, like any other young child, is silly and lovable. She can not do anything without hiding form her mother first, take a bath, get dressed or eat to name a few. I would use this with young children to relate to their love or relationships with their mothers or caretakers. If I were a parent, it would be a coveted bed time story.",
            "Little Night is a simple book about a mother getting her daughter ready. She bathes, dresses, and feeds Little Night, each time having to find find her where she's hiding. The book has the most beautiful illustrations I have ever seen. They really capture the beauty of dusk and night - and of the special relationship between a mother and daughter. My daughter and I read this book every night and just adore it!"

Hastily recalled home to Israel, drawn once more into the heart of a service he had once forsaken, Allon finds himself stalking an elusive master terrorist across a landscape drenched with generations of blood, the trail turning on itself until, finally, he can no longer be certain who is stalking whom. And when at last the showdown comes, it will not be Gabriel alone who is threatened with destruction\u2014for it is not his history alone that has been laid bare.A knife-edged thriller of astonishing intricacy and feeling, filled with exhilarating prose, this is Daniel Silva\u2019s finest novel yet.",

            "\u201cWe have prayed for impossible things. Peace without justice, forgiveness without restitution, \u2026love without sacrifice.\u201dIn \u201cPrince of Fire\u201d, the 5th novel in the Gabriel Allon series, you can tell that the author, Daniel Silva, has had it with Palestinian terrorism. He broaches the topic in a very different manner than he did in the first novel in the series.In this text, Silva unflinchingly depicts Yasir Arafat for what he was\u2026a two-bit terrorist whose goal was the extermination of the Jews. Arafat is given the unflattering portrait he deserves in this book. Silva makes clear that Arafat\u2019s rejections of peace cost many people their lives. However, what makes Mr. Silva such an interesting writer is that he turns that unflinching eye on both sides of the conflict. He details the Palestinian grievance in Israel with honesty and truth, which does not often happen in books that deal with this issue. An Israeli character gives his reasoning for the brutal expulsion of some Arabs from their homes in 1947/48 and you the reader can hear his argument and decide for yourself what to make of it.I have propelled thru this series because Dan Silva is a good writer and a good storyteller. In the world of thriller fiction, that is a rare combo. Some examples from \u201cPrince of Fire\u201d include a section where the protagonist (Gabriel Allon) analyzes the case he is working on in the same manner he would a piece of art that he is restoring. It is an excellent analogy and the writing in this section is top notch. In another section, a victim of Hamas terrorism gives a bitter and passionate account of a bus bombing that is chilling to read.This series keeps getting better. I will be sure to move on to number 6 soon! ",

            "Shortly before his departure he dressed in one of Herr Klemp\u2019s egregious suits and stalked the discos and nightclubs along Sheinkin Street in Tel Aviv. Herr Klemp was all that he, and by extension Mario Delvecchio, was not \u2013 a loquacious bore, a womanizer, a man who liked expensive drink and techno music. He loathed Herr Klemp, yet at the same time welcomed him, for Gabriel never felt truly safe unless wearing the skin of another man\u2026Gabriel Allon is in Venice, working as art restorer Mario Delvecchio, and living with Chiara, daughter of the chief Rabbi, when the Israeli Embassy in Rome is the target of a car bomb, followed by gunmen firing on those attempting to escape. When Italian authorities track the perpetrators to an abandoned apartment in Milan, they find there an encrypted CD, which they hand over to Tel Aviv. Decoded, it holds a dossier on Gabriel with photos of him and Chiara in Venice. The pair are recalled to Israel, and under the watchful eye of former spy-chief, Ari Shamron, Gabriel assembles a team to hunt the mastermind behind the Rome attack, and it is Dina who suggests a link to the Black September terrorist group. Gabriel goes undercover as a German businessman",
            "Fast-paced and action packed entertainment.",
            "This is not the best book that Silva has done. There is lots of history in this book. Most of this is correct and it is in keeping with what actually happened in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.Unfortunately, it takes away from the story. The story almost seems secondary to the historical perspective of the story line. Even though it is a Gabriel Allon book, it seems that there is lack of focus in this book, where it drifts along. Not as focused or as quick moving as the rest of the Silva books!However, it is a part of the development of the Allon character books. That was fun and was worth the read. But, this is far from Silva's best work!",
            "Another great entry in the Gabriel Allon series. ",
            "It is difficult and somewhat arrogant for someone like me---a well-off middle-income American Christian suburbanite from Ohio---to have an opinion about the Middle East, especially in regards to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. I don\u2019t even know what to call it, so I\u2019ll just call it an \u201cissue\u201d. (Is \u201cwar\u201d appropriate? Is \u201chatred\u201d accurate? Is it politically incorrect to call it \u201cgenocide\u201d? What the hell do you call it without offending either or both sides?)There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know or understand about what is going on in the Middle East, mainly because there is so much I don\u2019t know or understand about what is going on in my own country most of the time that the events happening hundreds of thousands of miles away, across the ocean, are all just white noise. I hate to say that, but it\u2019s the truth.I like to pride myself on being someone who tries to stay current with what is going on in the world, but most of the time---and especially lately---I have had this frantic isolationist approach to the world. I just want to hole up with my wife and daughter, \u201cbunker down\u201d, stay socially distant, and the government\u2019s \u201crecommendation\u201d to stay at home is strongly influencing these thoughts.Silver lining: I\u2019m getting a lot of reading done, especially of some books that I had set aside, with every intention of someday reading them. Now that libraries and bookstores are closed, that \u201csomeday\u201d is now.I was, a few months ago, on a Daniel Silva reading kick, and then I just stopped for no apparent reason. So, I\u2019m picking up where I left off, which was the fifth book in his series featuring Israeli super-spy Gabriel Allon, \u201cPrince of Fire\u201d.After a Jewish embassy is bombed in Rome, leaving many dead, Allon is called in to spearhead the manhunt of the person or persons behind the bombing. Allon is given a hand-picked team, under the supervision of his boss and mentor, Ari Shamron.Connecting dots of similar bombings---a community center in Buenos Aires and a synagogue in Istanbul---and significant dates that are too significant to be coincidental, Allon\u2019s team discovers that the man behind the bombing is a man whose very existence has been reduced to a myth, a man who has been shaped by a violent history between Palestinians and Israelis.It is a history in which Allon is complicit, and one for which he feels some guilt. It is a history, on the other hand, in which his boss, Shamron, takes pride. Shamron, like his Palestinian counterpart, Yasir Arafat, are part of the old-school hard-line militants, slowly dying off, but not slow enough for Allon.Going into further detail would be spoilers, but it\u2019s needless to say that Silva has written another fast-paced edge-of-the-seat espionage action thriller, one that tackles timely subjects in an intelligent and compassionate manner.",
            "Best of the series...in my opinion ",
            "This is a more serious book than any of the later books in the series (at least, of the ones I've read). Daniel Silva is more evidently on a soapbox, linking more of the story's fiction to his version of history and reality. Unfortunately, this reminds me of efforts such as The Da Vinci Code in which the author professes that the fiction is based on facts --- but which facts, and whose interpretation of facts? As with the scientific method, which eschews all aspects of bias in its blind test, any hint of tainting invalidates the results. And so I can only approach such books as Prince Of Fire as entertainment, discounting whatever the author claims to be truth.Taken in this light, the novel is engaging, in the nature of a frivolous feel good action movie, where good prevails over evil, and the righteous are justified. Silva writes with a panache that is quite apt for spy thrillers. His is opposite the tongue-in-cheek machinations of Ian Fleming, hewing more to John le Carr\u00e9 and filled with gravitas, quite sure of his message and purpose.Here, the main protagonist, Gabriel Allon, an Israeli assassin who is also an expert art restorer, is set to end his career. His wife, the victim of a terrorist attack meant to kill him, is abducted, in a delightfully convoluted plot by master jihadist Khaled. With the skill of a trained killer, Allon escapes the trap set by Khaled, saves his wife, and kills some terrorists. Silva's writing is spare and hi-res clear, placing readers in the middle of the action. The rest of the book seems to be a setup for the retirement of Allon, with an offered promotion to operational administration of the Israeli spy service, the return of his wife's memory and the departure of his young lover, Keira, and his relocation to Jerusalem. But, of course, we know that retirement for Allon is far in the horizon as the number of follow up books featuring this popular hero attest. The book concludes with an uninspired (from the writing viewpoint) assassination by Allon of Khaled. This last seems a superfluous element but underlines the author's concept that the cause represented by his main character Allon is just with closure achieved only by a victorious Prince of Fire."

Now, drawing on interviews with band members, producers, and colleagues, music journalist Simon Goddard presents a meticulous chronological survey of the group's musical evolution, from their first demos in 1982 to their final fractured studio session five years later. Investigating the stories behind the songs, and detailing every British TV and radio session, he also offers a unique analysis of each track's concert life. Granted unprecedented access to The Smiths' studio archives and to the private collection of outtakes and rehearsals retained by drummer Mike Joyce, the author lifts the lid on unreleased material as well as the lost songs and alternate versions that have remained closely guarded secrets until now.",

            "The root cause of my love for these four really dates back to first hearing Frankly Mr Shankly on an old record in 2002 (at which point I'd have been about six years old). After that I pretty much fell in love with each of their songs and the harsh reality of life they presented whilst growing more and more enamoured with Morrissey but well never mind, never mind. I curse myself for not existing during the time when these guys were at their prime; by the time I was able to appreciate them in full Moz was already on his eighth(?) solo album and The Smiths were long gone. As a whole: an excellent chronology for dedicated fans. Interesting to learn about the true bones of the songs & what made them work (and what didn't). Notably an impressive focus on the songs themselves as well (instead of lingering on the feuds) with necessary details in between. Its persuaded me to look into purchasing some of the old vinyl records",
            "This is the perfect book for fans of the Smiths and Morrissey. Every song, concert or TV appearance is listed and it's a great history of The Smiths from the beginning to the bitter end with the royalty disputes, court cases and the beginning of Morrissey and Marr's solo careers. I loved it so much that I have started to listen to the complete collection on Spotify reissue! repackage! repackage! (Paint a Vulgar Picture).",
            "Ik beschouw mezelf als een heel grote Smiths-fan. Al van toen ik voor het eerst de intro hoorde van This Charming Man. Ik had al hun offici\u00eble LP\u2019s en kocht nadien ook nog eens de CD\u2019s. Plus diverse verzamelalbums, songbooks en gitaartabs. En ook nu nog luister ik regelmatig naar hun muziek die volgens mijn bescheiden mening nog even sterk is als 35 jaar geleden.In dit boek wordt het verhaal verteld achter hun songs en hoe ze tot stand kwamen.Maar dat is zo gedetailleerd dat het zelfs voor mij al gauw saai werd. Ik denk dat het fout was om dit boek trachten te lezen als een roman. Maar ik heb het nu en als ik ooit nog eens wat meer achtergrond wil weten over een song van The Smiths weet ik waar het te vinden is.",
            "Definitely geared towards the hardcore Smiths fan, this book has all the info & stats on every song they ever recorded/performed... We're not getting any new music out of them, so a deeper knowledge of what we have is the next best thing. For the misunderstood teenager in all of us...",
            "This one's different from what I expected. I can't really say exactly what I expected, but this isn't it, but that's not a bad thing.Anyhow! This is a precise catalogue of all the Smiths recordings that ever existed, listed in chronological order, with the band's history described sketchily, sort of as a backdrop. There are some anecdotes, but not that many, which just underlines the main message of the book: it's the songs that are important; everything else is secondary.Goddard is a fan, but his tone is fairly subdued and meausured, and he's often critical of the band, which is cool. While he occasionally touches on the origin and meaning of the lyrics, he does not engage in idle speculation, which was ultimately a relief to me.Ultimately, the book accomplished its goal: I listen to familiar songs with, ah, new ears, I sought out recordings previously unknown to me, and so on. (And I'd like to use the book as a reference book too, but I dunno if I'll have the determination)Oh and, awesome title. Though reputedly it was chosen by the publisher, and the author himself disliked it.",
            "Having read both Morrissey and Johnny Marr's respective books as well as two bios about The Smiths what else is there to say about the legendary Manchunian band that achieved music immortality following a short and bittersweet five year career? Simon Goodard's Songs That Saved Your Life puts a new spin on well trodden ground as he retells the story of The Smiths by chronologically deconstructing the band's entire discography. Goodard is obviously a Smiths fanatic and his Smithdom is immense but he remains an objective narrator both passionate and poetic about The Smiths' legacy but quick to point out their individual flaws too. Goodard not only knows his music theory and his way round a studio but he also as an eye for detail regarding pop culture and literature making him the ideal author to perform the autopsy on The Smiths' back catalogue. Die hard fans of The Smiths pride themselves on favouring the most obscure of songs in the band's repertoire so with its obscure facts and insights Songs That Saved Your Life is essential reading for the geekiest of fans.",
            "Not much to say as the five stars above says it all. If you're a Smiths fan, this book is a must. The origins of every song and all the details are within. The most valuable aspect of this book was the discovery of the oldest known recording of Morrissey and Marr doing a cover of the Cookies, I Want a Boy For My Birthday. It is currently in the hands of a private collector but the owner was kind enough to at least copy it for us and upload it on the Internet so we can all enjoy it. So again",
            "While the book can be a bit repetitive with the information that it offers, it does serve as an excellent reference resource. I found myself reading about every third song or so that I was most interested in and wasn\u2019t disappointed with what I discovered. This is so clearly a labour of love for the author and his efforts are a justly rewarding read for any fan of The Smiths.",

            "Being a middle-aged dude and a Smiths fan since I was 15, it was a fun read. Interesting to hear the stories behind the songs and I like how it's laid out chronologically. It made me think about how important it is to listen to an album in its entirety as laid out by the artist. I don't do that like I used to now that I use digital media. Also made me miss liner notes. I wish I hadn't sold all my vinyl in 1993. All in all, I appreciate the book as a fan. The whole thing is like reading a DIY zine from back in the day. I got a kick out of reading it and am listening to the Meat is Murder album as I type. ",
            "Exactly what I was hoping it would be, 'Songs That Saved Your Life' will quench the curiosity of even the most extreme fans of the band. Goddard not only explains the songs themes and meanings, but goes into when, where, how, why, and even each tracks effect and achievement. The level of detail is truly incredible. Thanks to Goddard I look at The Smiths in a new light and love them more than ever!I only wish I knew more about the making of music in an attempt to better understand and appreciate the genius of the band.",

            "Informative and entertaining, this is almost a biography of the band, following the chronological recording of the Smiths' songs, along with a potted history just to give some background. The book follows them song by song, with slightly more emphasis on the music rather than the lyrics. A great read for any fan of The Smiths."

            "Doug Wilson's foreword to The Gospel Blimp begins, there is a difference between being a contrarian and being a grouch. Wilson goes on to observe that",
            "Joseph Bayly had a unique perspective as a story teller. So often we are told a writer should just tell a story and not try to make a point, but that sure isn't the way Jesus told stories. Bayly understood you could go into a story with the intention of teaching a lesson, and yet still make his characters and his stories rich. The Gospel Blimp is, of course, the main attraction and still has much to teach about mistakes made in evangelism. The two Gooley stories are great fun, poking fun at the uncomfortable balance of being in the world but not of it. How Silently is one of the best stories ever in the what if Jesus lived in our time genre. But I think my favorite story in the book is Remembering John",
            "The first story about the Gospel blimp was great! It was clear that one of the take aways was that our efforts to serve Christ and share our faith should be in the simple rubbing of shoulders with our neighbors and not an elaborate scheme and complicated and timely programming to where we have little time to even say hello to those around us. The rest of the stories in this book where a mixed bag of decent and confusing stories. Perhaps confusing is not the right word. I simply didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to communicate with some of them. But don\u2019t get me wrong, the Gospel blimp was superb!",
            "Decent enough read. I bought the book for The Gospel Blimp. It was an interesting little read, for sure. I probably enjoyed a few of the short stories more. That said, there were a few I was glad to finish because they were not so great. All in all, a quick read and a book that will make you think. ",

            "\u201cThe Gospel Blimp\u201d short story is definitely the reason to pick up this book. The other short stories are...not as good. I\u2019m rating this solely on \u201cThe Gospel Blimp.\u201d Poignant and convicting, \u201cThe Gospel Blimp\u201d mirrors American evangelism. We spend so much and do so little. This story cuts through the appearance of our self-righteousness to the problem at hand...why don\u2019t we just witness to those we know?

Samuel Morris began life as Kaboo, the eldest son of a tribal chieftain. He was a prince, but then he became a pawn-held in torturous limbo until his father could pay ransom to an enemy tribe. When Kaboo's captors became too greedy, and no amount of ivory could rescue him, a death of unbelievable cruelty awaited. And then God intervened. From Kaboo's miraculous escape, to his acceptance of Christ and baptism by missionaries, to his remarkable voyage to America where he would have an amazing impact on scores of lives, the story of Samuel Morris is an is an adventure of divine proportions.",

Considering it is Black History month - and hearing from my friends that are African-American, the point has been made, rightfully so, that their history is much more than the story of slavery. With that in mind - might I suggest this beautiful living story about the Kaboo Prince turned Christian? ",

            "This book was recommended to me by a good friend who had literally poured over every book she could find on the topic of sleep. She sees it as the sleep bible. Unfortunately, I had a hard time with the book for several reasons. 1) It's very dense with a small typeface - note easy to read when you're exhausted and looking for a solution. 2) It's totally unclear where in the book there's actual practical information on how to help your child sleep.3) The author is strongly opinionated and has kind of a damning tone. As a new parent, it's hard to filter out other people's judgemental attitudes, especially experts",
            "First off, let me say that I didn't actually read this book cover to cover. I skimmed it. A LOT of people recommend this book",
            "This book is really flawed, I can't get away from that. If you're looking for a book of hints on getting your child to sleep, this isn't it - the title is misleading. Weissbluth is over-the-top about insisting kids get enough quality sleep (although that's arguably valuable in our overscheduled lives) and there are dire warnings for kids who don't. Sometimes the book is contradictory and it is poorly organized.So why my rare 5 star rating? It is just full of good information about sleep development. My fourth baby is an infant, and remembering that now is when she will start staying up really late at night but at 6 weeks will be ready for an earlier bedtime is sanity saving. Having an idea of when naps consolidate, what's a reasonable bedtime, and how to work through common challenges make my life easier. If you're totally on board with Babywise or Dr Sears, you will probably not love Weissbluth's advice, but if you're more middle-of-the road (like me) this has a ton of good information that is adaptable for different families without insisting on a moral path. He is accepting of cry it out, but if that's not your path then there is advice for the family bed. What he is most insistent on is that children - and their parents - get the sleep they need. If your method is not getting you baby good sleep, he's pushing you to change it. I would recommend parents not choose a day when they are desperate for sleep changes to read this. (Chapters have an action plan section",
            "This book makes me feel like a failure as a parent when my child has sleep issues. I hate his preachy tone and militant approach. I have literally thrown it across the room in frustration. Several times when we have encountered a new sleep issue with Nora, I go back to this book, hoping that he'll have some good advice. We are currently trying his sleep rules approach to deal with her getting out of bed a thousand times a night",
            "What a lifesaving book!Like many first-time parents, I started off pretty darn ignorant. I did everything wrong regarding my firstborn's sleep habits for the first about 9 months. I became a miserable being surviving on almost no sleep and lots of frustration. My baby turned into a sullen little thing, too. I knew something had to be done when I realized he hardly smiled or giggled at all.I researched different sleep-training books and liked the reviews from Amazon.com on this one, so I bought it.I recommend you read it with a highlighter and mark everything you want to be able to easily find again. Weissbluth doesn't format his writing very well and he often repeats himself or gets off track. But the INFORMATION contained is empowering!I applied the techniques and principles he teaches and WOW! It worked wonderfully. My marriage to my husband improved, I became a normal person again, and Brady became a sweet, happy baby again (instead of cranky from being sleep-deprived).I suggest you don't cheat when teaching your baby how to sleep because - I'm here to tell you - you will pay later on",
            "Decent. This book is really not great for babies under 4 months of age, although it did introduce me to an important concept (don't keep a very young baby awake for more than 2 hours!). It is geared more to babies 5+ months and toddlers, preschoolers, children. For the first four months, definitely go to Dr. Harvey Karp's The Happiest Baby on the Block",
            "The sleep bible! I swear this is the book that saved my life and now has me pregnant for the third time. Sleeping babies are the best babies ever, and this book teaches parents how to make sure their kids get all the sleep they need, how to get them to sleep, details on how much, napping, falling asleep in cars, etc - I still read it for my 3 year old and review it for my 1yr old...plus it has tips all the way to to the teen years. I have not met anyone yet who has religiously followed it say it doesn't work! The author was my nephew's pediatrician, and his mom gave me the book as a baby present, best gift ever!"

Austin Carr, with his \u2018infectious grin\u2019, is a down-on-his luck stockbroker saddled with a vicious ex-wife, office politics, and mucho debt to settle. It becomes much worse, however, when he ignores his instincts and takes a gamble on a bad deal. Will he be able to survive his mistake, or is this the big one he\u2019ll never walk away from?The fun \u2018hero\u2019 is humorous, shamelessly male in his pursuits, and a father with the right priorities where his kids are concerned. He is also one of those who life likes laughing at while it keeps tossing him cards of irony and chaos. The story\u2019s bombshell is classic noir \u2013 alluring, inviting, and dangerous. I won\u2019t go over every character but will say even the smaller roles stand out proudly. Even when they follow trademark roles, they\u2019re still enjoyable.Jack Getze delivers his tale smoothly using short paragraphs and mini chapters. Action and pacing keep the story moving at a good speed through humorous inner musings, convincing dialogue, and the classic traits which make a story shine. The ending holds at least two surprises, dishing out tantalizing twists mystery fans will enjoy.Overall, Big Numbers excels by borrowing age-old noir crime qualities we already know and love, but those familiarities are intertwined with a fresh, unique style all of its own.",
            "After both my husband and I read Jack Getze book, Big Numbers, we both came to the conclusion that we are surely glad to NOT be Austin Carr. No one person should have to endure all of the misadventures that this poor guy has had. This is a fast paced novel that tells the story of a down and out divorced stockbroker who has to try to find a way to get his children back and what he does to get this to happen is madcap adventures. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but do yourself a favor and read this book. It will make you glad that you are who you are and not being beaten, hit by a car, and kicked around by so many that a hospital stay would have been a vacation for him had it ever taken the time to be there long enough. Both of us enjoyed this book a lot; a very different approach to a murder mystery and a lot of humorous antics make this a really great novel to get your blood flowing. We received this book complimentary for no compensation other than an honest review.Both my husband and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little dark comedy and a adventure story. We are truly looking forward to Mr. Getze next book, and I bet you will too. ",
            "Won this book through a Goodreads giveaway and just finished it up.The MC, Austin Carr is a stockbroker who has gone down further than rock bottom: his wife divorced him, he's not making any money as a stockbroker, since no money he can't see his kids, and he's been reduced to living in a rusty camper that he parks in a Mexican restaurant parking lot. His biggest client has health issues, the client's wife is coming on to him, another client is super pissed about an investment and wants to get revenge, and his supervisor is ready to take him down by any means necessary. All Austin Carr has to get him by is his famous full-boat Carr grin.All in all a good story, there were a couple of issues that left me hanging (the storylines with Psyco Sam and Rags), but maybe those will be addressed in the next book, which I can't wait to read!",
            "Hate the cover....LOVE the book!Austin Carr had me at HELLO!I was swooning for him within the first paragraph.For me, Mr. Carr made this book fabulous. I loved his ability to take a serious situation and morph it into something lighter. Some may question his shady ethics but you know deep down he is good people.I am typically not a fan of murder/mysteries but with Austin along for the ride i was totally digging the storyline. I was also really down with the short length chapters. It always left me with comfortable stopping/starting points.I will be reading more of Austin Carr. I HEART HIM!",
            "The dark humour in this book appealed to me, but what an immoral character Austin Carr is. How could anyone trust a stockbroking firm like his with their money? Plenty of subtle humour, an unbelievable story that kept getting more and more bizarre and an amazing ending. Not a very long book but very entertaining.",

Suddenly Nefertiti disappeared from the royal family, vanishing so completely that it was as if she had never been. No record survives to detail her death, no monument serves to mourn her passing, and to this day her end remains an enigma\u2014her body has never been found.

            "The bust of Nefertiti that is housed in Berlin\u2019s museum is one of the most famous icons in popular culture. Because of her beauty, she has become the symbol of Ancient Egypt. Her face is on key-rings, iphone cases, post-cards, t-shirts, etc. Aside from her image, who was the mysterious Nefertiti? How much power and influence did she actually have? What were her accomplishments besides being merely beautiful? Joyce Tyldesley\u2019s biography seeks to answer these questions. There are few known details about the life of Nefertiti. This is not only because of the long gap of time between our world today and Nefertiti\u2019s world, but because she is mostly in the background in Ancient Egypt. Nefertiti does not only stand behind the pharaoh, but she is glimpsed over by her formidable mother-in-law, Queen Tiy, who has much more power and influence as the Akhenaten's mother. However, Nefertiti gained some influence as the pharaoh's wife, she took on duties of priesthood, that was usually assigned to the pharaoh. She was also known as a dutiful and faithful wife. Overall, the novel gives us a tiny glimpse into the life of Nefertiti. Because not much is known about her, the author mostly focuses on Akhenaten and his reign. This novel is more of an archeological work and how Nefertiti has been interpreted. Tyldesley mentions the popular theories about Nefertiti and then debunks them as she goes along. I felt that she gave us thorough and comprehensive answers and did her best with the evidence she had. The conclusions about her birth and disappearance made sense. However, after reading this book, I found myself more interested in Queen Tiy than I was in Nefertiti. I felt that this biography knew more about Queen Tiy than it did of Nefertiti because of her prominence at court. I found it fascinating how Tiy, a commoner, had risen to become one of the most powerful women at court. While the writing is dry as a textbook, it is very comprehensible to the reader. The book has a lot of interesting pictures of Nefertiti. I also like how she incorporates how Nefertiti has been perceived in popular culture. This novel is a great introduction for those who want to learn about the Armana period of Ancient Egypt.",
            "Writing about icons is a difficult business. Even biographers of modern stars like Marilyn Monroe or Elvis Presley must wade through a morass of secrets, theories and fantasies. How much more difficult to choose a subject who lived 3,500 years ago, who emerged from nowhere, disappeared back into obscurity, and whose brief, glittering existence has been the subject of fierce iconoclasm! Thanks to the glorious portrait bust in Berlin (see below), Nefertiti is one of the most recognisable figures from Ancient Egypt, but the facts of her life remain tantalisingly elusive. As Joyce Tyldesley teases out the meaning of symbols, inscriptions and sculpted reliefs, Nefertiti\u2019s lost world blossoms into life, in an archaeological story that reads like a detective novel. This is a tale of religious revolution, intrigue, iconoclasm, romance, and mysterious, powerful women. What\u2019s not to like?For the full review, please see my blog:https://theidlewoman.net/2019/01/05/n...",
            "Skillfully researched, wonderfully illustrated/photographed and utterly captivating biography on one of Ancient Egypt\u2019s most intriguing and fascinating leading ladies. One of the most meticulous scholarly examinations on the life of a queen, wife, mother and warrior who changed the future of her nation. Tyldesley is one of my favorite Egyptologists and I found her interpretations of the many pieces of evidence from Ahketaten (Amarna) to be introspective, credible and thought-provoking.It convinces me that Nefertiti was highly influential on Akhenaten's initial decisions (Moving to the area where Akhetaten was built) and played a collaborative and strong role for Akhenaten while at Akhetaten. She certainly had to have been one of the few people in her husband\u2019s court whom he could trust absolutely. Nefertiti's influence and stature grew immeasurably with the birth of her Daughters, as well as her omnipotent status (a powerful allure that she has not lost",
            "Thoughtful and well researched, but we just don't know much of anything about Nefertiti, so the book ends up speculating a lot about Herself and talking a lot more about the previous ruler, Nefertiti's husband, and then her husband's successor.",
            "Blah. I love Egypt, and I love history. But this book nearly bored me to death.",
            "This has been a very interesting read and yet again Joyce has been unbiased in her evidence given, she has placed in the theories from both past and the then present at the time of publishing. I, however, would like to see an updated version of this as new things have come to light such the DNA and modern scanning of the mummies. While I did enjoy the book and I will say this is not my first time reading it, I would point out to a first time reader that it is not just about Nefertiti of her own accord. In fact, I would say there is more about her husband Amenhotep IV or Akhenaten than Nefertiti, I suppose to be fair that may because what we know of Nefertiti is through him which leads me to Seti I and Rameses II.I think one thing that is showing to be clear in not just Joyce Tyldesley's books is that Seti I and Rameses II were the main culprits in systematically destroying what they could what they did not agree with from the 18th dynasty. Hatshepsut, Amenhotep IV, Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ay were erased in form or another and Joyce is great in the fact she lays blame to the locals looking to make a quick buck.It would seem that Akhenaten is seen by many as the father of monotheism but Joyce I think rightly points that he couldn't totally be as Nefertiti and his children were part of his vision of the divine ennead and given the evidence to support this from Akhenaten himself it would be hard to dispute. Again I love to see an updated version of this book and I hope that the publisher or Joyce see fit to do so, the views given are just how I see them from what I have read and you should the book for yourself to draw you own conclusions.",
            "It really is ironic how we can write a complete book on a historical figure about whom we truly know almost nothing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Tyldesley writes in a way that is well-informed, engaging, and seeks to paint a picture. However, in order to discuss ancient figures surrounded by mystery, it is necessary to discuss much that comes before and after the person of interest, in order to even gain an outline of the picture. So, if you are looking for a book on the life of Nefertiti, you will get a lot more information than you are seeking.If you are looking for likely possibilities of life over a three generation span of the 18th dynasty, this is a great place to start. I respected that Tyldesley honestly acknowledges areas where the information is in doubt, as well as drawing conclusions about the most likely option. Given the nature of the portrayal of Egyptian reigns, as well as the knowledge we have lost over millennia, that seems the fairest approach to studies like this.It seems like Nefertiti landed herself in a pretty good position, with a fairly positive home and public life. The pictures of the Stella and sculptures referenced in the writing were beautiful\u2014as was the queen.",
            "You know you love the subject,person or area if you read absolutely everything you can get your hands on and see if there is any new snippet of information you can get your hands on and this book did not disappoint in the slightest and I am still sad that they still have not found her mummy and I think that it may be behind the walls of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's crypt and here is hoping that we find her soon."

            "Well done biography of W. Ironically, its not frothing at the mouth- not at all- and the Bush people ran him into the ground for what he wrote. I mean, all the way to the Ground.Watch Horns And Halos",
            "Reading this book makes me all weepy-eyed and nostalgic: remember when we hated him because he was an incompetant cokehead instead of a Constitution-shredding, child-murdering maniac?",
            "Notable more for what happened to the author and the book at the time of publication than for anything actually contained within the book. For those that don't like Bush there is plenty of red meat, there is also a huge credibility gap with the author. I will say that it can't be worse than most of the political hatchet jobs that have come out since. I worked in the industry at the time of publication and the Bush family used their connections to get it pulled from the shelves and destroyed, it was later reissued by soft skull press. Check out the doc Horns and Halos for the whole sordid affair. ",
            "If America could have collectively read this book, we wouldn't be in the situation we are today. It is a complete documentation of George W. Bush's life BEFORE he ran for president - completely documented. The Bushies never disputed one fact in the book. Instead, they threatened large publishers who had any significant sort of distribution so that the book would not receive public attention. There is a good documentary the covers the trials the author went through to get the book published and distributed. It is too late obviously to undo the damage Boy George has done. But the book is worth reading because it shows 1) the information was out there before the election 2) it showed without exaggeration, distortion or lie that W is/was an utter incompetent. 3) information can be suppressed in a free society in creative ways 4) it could very well happen again (though it is unlikely just statistically speaking that we could elect a president as bad as W even if we tried). Finally",
            "Honestly, I thought this book would be better. It wasn't the writing that I didn't like, but with all the hype that surrounded this book, I thought it would include some really ground-breaking stuff. It doesn't really. A little bit of this history: The original publisher decided not to sell the book after they had printed a number of copies. They went to the extreme step of destroying the books that they had printed already. Then the author was found dead and was presumed to have committed suicide. Then another publisher decided to publish the book.",
            "Insightful as to why W. is such a failure. He has skated his way to the top and never had to earn anything. In his earlier years, oil companies gave him positions of power solely because of his name. Every oil company that he lead, he drove into the ground only to be bailed out by daddies friends latter. This book explains George W. Bushs' debts to industry and carefully itemizes them. The author was careful to check his facts.",
            "Wes let me borrow this book. It had so much detail. I did find it exhausting to read. The author had so much information to work with and provided tons of footnotes and information on the side.Overall, I learned a lot but the writing didn't flow as well as it could have.Given the circumstances of the author's death, I would suggest only minimally editing the book for an easier read.

            "If you know Muddy Waters, you know the blues. If you listen to The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, and countless other voices, you get to hear the influence of Muddy Waters. If you read this book, you get to know the life that informed all the Muddy was and what made him an authentic Delta blues man for his lifetime.We can read about what it meant to be a Southern black and a sharecropper, but through Muddy Waters we get to hear what it meant, how it becomes part of one's bones, and how a man could find freedom through his music. Muddy was illiterate but savvy; he was a man in every sense, just listen to his lyrics. He was also selfless, accepted responsibility for the women he married and those he didn't along with his children, loyal in the music industry often to his own detriment, helpful to other musicians, and fiercely protective of his performances and look. He lived a hard life on the plantation and as a musician. Working hard was what he knew, and he played hard too among an often hard and threatening crowd, especially when he moved to Chicago.In all things, Muddy Waters is legendary and so is his music. This book is a fascinating and gripping read, taking the reader into the places where Muddy operated, making you feel both climate and vibe. As a fan of the blues and Muddy Waters, I was captivated by the life of this extraordinary man who continues to influence great music in a contemporary world, even if that influence is under the radar.",
            "If you are a blues fan then Muddy Waters\u2019 name and legacy are easily recognizable. He brought the Mississippi Delta sound to Chicago, electrified it and redefined the genre. Two young British musicians, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, lifted the name of one of Muddy\u2019s songs when they named their newly founded band. Jann Wenner did the same when he started his new magazine in 1967. When Bob Dylan went \u201celectric\u201d, his first song was entitled Like a Rolling Stone. Guitar legends Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page are or were huge Muddy Waters fans. The adage goes \u201cThe Blues had a baby and they called it Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d Muddy Waters was the \u201cbaby\u2019s\u201d godfather. So regardless if the name rings a bell, Waters\u2019 influence on the music we listen to today is prevalent.Robert Gordon\u2019s book is an attempt to give us the story of McKinley Morganfield\u2019s, (Muddy\u2019s real name), life; from the Mississippi cotton plantation where he was raised, his move to Chicago and attaining world-wide fame. I use the word attempt because much of what we know of Muddy\u2019s life is either what he decided we should know or what his friends and fellow musicians felt comfortable sharing. Muddy was virtually illiterate, so there is very little documentation. What we have are a lot of stories and anecdotes. The author does a very good job in parsing through these, confirming what he can while still giving us an engaging story.Gordon also does a very good job in analyzing Muddy\u2019s impact on music and his subsequent legacy - First, his influence among his fellow bluesmen, then on the new musical genre of rock and roll; and across the Atlantic Ocean and the birth of the British invasion.And because the stories go hand in hand with Muddy\u2019s, the book also chronicles the evolution of the Chicago blues scenes and Chess Records. This includes such lesser known musicians such as Otis Spann, Little Walter and Jimmy Rogers, among others.Can\u2019t Be Satisfied may not be the perfect biography, but as stated above verifying much of Muddy\u2019s life is difficult. Also at times the metaphors in this book are somewhat overwrought \u2013\u201cHis notes float like crimson leaves that skip in the wind.\u201d - just to highlight one. All in all though, particularly if you are a blues fan, this is a very good read.",
            " One of the best music biographies I've ever read. More than just the story of one of the most influential figures in the history of popular music, this is the story of the blues. Gordon traces Waters from his days as a Mississippi sharecropper, to nights spent playing at fish frys in plantation juke joints, to his big break recording for the Library of Congress, to the smokey blues clubs of Chicago and beyond. In addition to a larger than life subject (a hard drinking, poker paying, gun toting womanizer) the book is populated with a supporting class that reads like a who's who of blues: Alan Lomax, Phil and Leonard Chess, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, Willy Dixon,Junior Wells, Eric Clapton,Keith Richards, Otis Spann and more. Gordon clearly has great affection for his subject and has spared no effort to interview pretty much every living person who ever met Waters. Nearly half the book is an exhaustive appendix that is an invaluable resource for fans of both Waters and the blues.",
            "The Chicago suburbs where I grew up are a long way from the Mississippi Delta. The north suburbs are also in a parallel universe far from the south side of what has been called the most segregated city in America. The country blues of the Deep South played primarily on acoustic instruments came north with the musicians as northern wartime industries expanded and the great migration of African-Americans from the South was at its height during WWII and immediately afterwards. Reflecting the frenetic, mechanized, densely populated urban environment of Chicago, the instruments got plugged in and the Chicago Blues were born, complete with a big beat, wailing electric guitars, and soulful harmonica and piano playing. A Chicago kid myself, I only picked up on the blues secondhand (like many baby boomers) through English musicians like the Animals, Yardbirds, Pretty Things, and most of all the Rolling Stones. Well, turns out THOSE musicians were getting inspired by music coming out of what was after all my own back yard. In fact the latter band's name was inspired by a 1950s Muddy Waters' hit, Rollin' Stone. Of all the Chicago bluesmen",
            "The first book I can remember reading, in the 1950s, was a young adult biography of John Paul Jones.That doesn\u2019t mean I love biographies. Honestly, I don\u2019t read them much.My taste in history runs to chronologies, regional and epochal frames of reference, les longues dur\u00e9es of the French Annalistes\u2026.Recently I jumped out of my comfort zone to read Can\u2019t Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters. I\u2019m a fan of the blues, and original Delta blues is good times music for me. Muddy Waters and \u201cMannish Boy\u201d are right up at the top of my list.Robert Gordon, the author of this jam-packed Waters bio, offered this thought about his genre:\u201cBiography is the process of securing what is mutable. Undertaking the creation of one requires embracing the paradoxical: the writer is asked to create the skin and soul of a person, but not to inhabit it.\u201dThat\u2019s rather deep stuff, I think. It reminds me to mention that I\u2019m no fan of the \u201cgreat man\u201d style of writing history, even when the great man is a great blues man.Read more of my book reviews on my website: http://richardsubber.com/",
            "After a summary of the economics of share-cropping, to include one half of the gross to the plantation owner, and the other half, minus all bills, to the share-cropper, maybe the result is positive for the share-cropper, maybe not. The company store may charge unreasonable-high prices. The local plantation script may be intentionally devalued. In other words, the share-cropper gets screwed.In summary: Sharecropping - getting less than half of what you've got coming to you - was good training for a life in the music business. Page 9.Born in 1913",
            "This book is well written and an interesting read, even though I struggled getting through the details of the early years.It was interesting to read about all of the great bluesmen that were influenced by Muddy Waters and actually played in his band, such as Jimmy Rogers, Little Walter, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, James Cotton, Junior Wells, and many others. It was heartbreaking to read how many of these pioneers of the blues actually died pretty young and penniless, screwed over by the record companies. It is especially heartbreaking when you consider the millions of dollars the rich and spoiled rock stars of the 70s and beyond have made from the songs and blood, sweat, and tears of these early bluesmen.I have not read other books about Muddy Waters so I cannot compare this book to any others. I can tell you that I found it well organized and interesting most of the time. The book cleared up some of my misperceptions and knowledge gaps about Muddy Waters.I highly recommend it. ",
            "This was an interesting read. I don't know if I learned a lot about who Muddy Waters was, but I learned a lot of what he did. The author makes a lot of Waters' sharecropping background and the idea that he was subservient to the record companies and didn't really question what he was getting as long as he was taken care of. I know a lot of recording artists have gotten screwed by record companies and it wasn't because they were sharecroppers. I learned what others thought of Muddy and what he did, but not so much what motivated him and what he thought. I understand that it may be difficult as Muddy was mostly illiterate and didn't record his thoughts and many of those he interacted with are now dead. However, I would've liked more insight.As other reviewers mentioned, the book bogs down with gig schedules. I've always avoided Muddy's later recordings, but the book introduced me to Hard Again",
            "McKinley Morganfield came up the Stovall Plantation in the Mississippi Delta playing in the dangerous water so much that his Grandmother gave him the name Muddy. He started picking cotton, playing music and finally got his first guitar after seeing Son House who would remain a big influence. He became Muddy waters after moving to Chicago and influenced many rock musicians such as the Rolling Stones who took their name from one of his songs as well as countless blues musicians. I was lucky enough to see Muddy Waters live at Chicagofest on Navy Pier in the early 80\u2019s. I can\u2019t say I remember much except that he was sitting down playing long, slow, searing guitar licks with a slide on a Fender Telecaster. At the time I wasn\u2019t really aware of the range of his influence since I was just enjoying the music, but he influenced rock bands as well as blues musicians and even a well known rock magazine took its name from one of his songs, Rolling Stone.",
            "An excellent account of Muddy's development from acoustic blues in the delta to electric blues in Chicago. He led the way in updating the music from an agricultural environment to an urban setting where he created the music which so heavily influenced younger musicians in the Stones and people like Clapton & Page.The book pulls no punches and shows aspects of Muddy's life & character which do not show him in a good light. It offers insights into the other musicians & people he worked closely with such as Little Walter & Leonard Chess.We also find out about what life was like cotton picking in the delta and why workers left for the north when this process became mechanised.It is well researched with numerous references and even refers to the work of Lomax who travelled the south recording singers & musicians for the American Library. This was valuable work as, otherwise, these early versions of the blues may have been lost.I would thoughly recommend this book.",
            "So much detail in this book. Exhaustive investigation of his early life and legendary encounters with key icons in American music. One drawback is the author spends a LOT of time detailing Muddy's sexual exploits in a way that isn't relevant to the story. Like, I just need to know that Muddy hooked with the lady across the street because she was renowned for her sexual prowess, I don't need to read several paragraphs about what it was exactly that she did.Small drawback in an otherwise excellent book. The discography is great. I am re-reading this one too because there's so much in it it's hard to get it all the first time.",
            "An exhaustive biography of the seminal electric blues man, Muddy Waters, but it is a difficult and slow read. I appreciate the vast research that went into the book, however I felt that the author could have used more judicious editing.Still this is a thorough documentation of the life of one of the most important American folk musicians and if you are a blues fan you will want to delve into it.",
            "This book is a must for any blues fan. It tells the story of one of the great masters of the blues Muddy Waters and how he and other Chicago blues greats like Howling Wolf and Little Walter changed the direction of contempory music forever. It is well told and not only outlines his brilliant musical career but also also his relationships with the Chess brother, his women and some of his children. A great book.",
            "Jeff says:I was lucky enough to see Muddy Waters live at Chicagofest on Navy Pier in the early 80\u2019s.

            "Not bad overall, and the long quoted sections where it's just Muddy talking are really enjoyable. Unfortunately the author is a huge dork and every few pages there's a cringe-worthy dad joke, or another piece of 'blues wisdom' imparted by a middle-aged white guy who was probably a virgin until the age of 30.",
            "Nothing but Muddy here. This is a very enjoyable read that brings you from Delta to Chicago in the most personal terms. A panoramic introduction the the Blues greats from the greatest. You will learn a lot more than about blues music in this book, since it reveals a great deal about a vibrant sector of the American experience .",
            "It makes me want to walk the steps of muddy and I thought that the author did a great job causing you to research other blues artists that played with muddy, and inspired him. I spent many hours listening to muddy and other artists because of this book.",
            "First there is the music: deep, powerful, sexy. You have to get that on your own.Then there is the man -- simple, complicated, ignorant, brilliant -- and the hurricane in which he set sail. You get some help here.Essential reading.",
            "Muddy Waters was and continues to be the King of the Chicago blues. At the time of his passing I was playing in my first blues band and covering a lot of his classic tunes. Reading this book brought back the shock and loss of his death and the triumph of his life. God Bless Muddy Waters.",
            "Muddy Waters inspired magazines, hundreds of musicians and left a sizeable musical legacy, this book recounts his life well, his greatness and his flaws; his work and his private life.If you are a blues fan, this is a must read."

I'll be here, sitting on the floor surrounded by cupcakes, ice cream and some twisted books, like an existentialist Bridget Jones, just contemplating my own ridiculous existence, thanks to you guys and your crude and insightful comments about life and its inevitable absurdity. It is a tough read. Especially if you feel like a giant failure that never lived, but existed (to live, one of the rarest thing in the world, according to another great writer). I don't know about the life situation (and mental health condition) of you people out there, so I will certainly avoid the pressure of recommending this book. At the same time, I wish everyone could enjoy Sartre's beautiful writing. Yes, that is beautiful. And not too difficult to understand.A couple of samples:Something has happened to me",
            "(Book 602 from 1001 books) - La Naus\u00e9e = Nausea, Jean-Paul SartreNausea is a philosophical novel by the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, published in 1938. It is Sartre's first novel and, in his opinion, one of his best works. Antoine Roquentin protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has been living in Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations\u0648 and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his research on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a sweetish sickness",
            "SARTRE HAD IT RIGHT; BUT HE TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY.His Nausea is an undisputed MASTERPIECE. But like me at my coming of age, he covered up its huge insights into his own failings behind a Facade of Self-Deception.In this book, Sartre saw correctly that our world is Crazy Sick. But by sidestepping the problem of his own sickness through Reason, he made it worse for himself. And in the end he died of it.That\u2019s his problem. If we don\u2019t admit we\u2019re all infected with this Crazy Sickness, we won\u2019t seek - or find - REAL HELP. We\u2019ll be in Terminal Denial. We all need Help.Don't get me wrong. I think nausea IS the only authentic reaction to modern life. Its hypocrisy sickens, of course - and Sartre is at least right in that. But then, afterward, acceptance of all that is ESSENTIAL. Gotta bite the bullet.The other day, I decided to skim this novel again, after so many years had passed since I read it, and was thunderstruck. Why? Because it describes exactly the same experience I had 50 years ago! It\u2019s an experience which has continued uninterrupted since that time - see my Kindle notes.When I read this book in the 1980\u00b4s I must have ignored its meaning. It was Crazy Sickness. It\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s the Barthian experience of the Alterity of God. Sartre, ever the pessimistic atheist, thought it was the perception of the nothingness of middle-class values. And that\u2019s too bad.T.S. Eliot says some people have the experience and miss the meaning. Many are called but few are chosen. So most folks, perhaps, prize this epiphany in their memory for the rest of their lives but are not fundamentally changed by it. Fred Buechner, though, said we have to SPEAK FROM OUR PAIN...And to see results after such a satori, hard work must follow. And I wrestled with it, as I say, for 50 years. It was a long, cold, hard slog. Until, finally, peace and freedom ensued. But Roquentin - Sartre - just endured its temporary internal pressure for a while, and then continued toward pure futility on his angry, counter cultural way. With great anguish.So it\u2019s a groundbreaking novel about the thunderous, dual irruption of being and facticity into a young man\u2019s life, and for him everything is left in the air for the one who experiences it.You know, it always happens in exactly this way.For at that very moment when we try to seize the prize of Pure Being for ourselves we are necessarily forced to wrestle with a phony world of Being-for-Others - becoming ACTORS in a world we didn\u2019t create.The result is earthshaking for poor, nondescript Roquentin! He, like unlucky Prometheus, has suddenly and shamefacedly stolen Fire from the gods. And a pretty tawdry bunch of gods they\u2019ve turned out to be in his judgemental eyes. But Roquentin grabbed the stick by the Wrong end. You just have to just KEEP GOING - and d*mn the Torpedoes!Once you cross that invisible line in front of your unwary feet, the world falls on its stunned head, and proper orientation is anyone\u2019s guess.Where truth lies now is in unending aporia... a banal flux for Sartre, who had like Nietzsche, transvalued all traditional values, and suddenly:All is changed, changed UTTERLY -A Terrible Beauty is born!A similar thing happened to me when I was a kid. It was pivotal in my development and in my choices as an adult. I had to choose, and fast! It\u2019s like George Santayana said: one day you wake up and realize \u201clife\u2019s not a spectacle - it\u2019s a struggle.\u201dBut for me, it originated from God, I was certain of it. I submitted myself to His Absolute Alterity. Once you\u2019re on that road, there\u2019s no going back. You can\u2019t go home. At least at first...You know, Kafka once wrote a paragraph or two in his notebooks on the Prometheus parable, which describes the anguish that must follow such an experience for us all.He says, that after incalculable aeons, Prometheus, his chains, and the rock he\u2019s chained to in punishment for his sins, all merge into one continuous solid entity.That merging is our return to Wholeness. And the ordinary sensory world - totally divested of extraneous pop gobbledygook - is now \u201cmagnifique, totale et solitaire\u201d.For if we endure the factitious encounter with Becoming patiently, and \u201cin good faith\u201d, one day we will merge with the Rock of Being in peace.It is painfully and near-impossibly difficult. But that is the Path.And it is the Path to our Freedom and Wholeness.One hundred years before Sartre penned this novel, a great Dane suffered the same cataclysmic bifurcation of his being - and, at first, the same unutterable anguish. For him it led to Wholeness too.His name was S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. But - crucially, and in stark contradistinction to Sartre - Kierkegaard found blessed release from it in the end. Sporadically at first, but you can see final freedom was there.You can see his solution in his short masterwork Fear and Trembling...Through a series of subtle and cuttingly double-edged variations on the old, old story of Abraham and Isaac - the original sacrifice - he lays the immovable foundation of Postmodernist Christian Faith. Seen from almost every possible type of viewpoint out of a myriad range of possibilities.And his ineluctable inner logic overpowered all his naysayers.In fact Fear and Trembling paved the way for such modern cutting-edge Christians as Karl Barth and Hans Kung, both the brains trust and the conscientious soul of our new 21st century churches - institutions that seem to the untrained eye to be so out of touch.Perhaps they\u2019re only out of touch to the jaundiced eyes of Big Brother Media. Just try to look at it all a bit deeper! These thinkers are the substance under the New Christians\u2019 (somewhat regrettable) glitter. All that glitters is not gold:You\u2019ve gotta KNOW yourself as well as the World. By dissing the world you\u2019re just digging a bigger hole.And though Sartre somewhat hastily discarded Modern Faith out of hand, we don\u2019t necessarily have to make the same despairing mistake, nor would we have to undergo any more desperate Sartrian anguish, if we chose to do otherwise...and Believe.For the choice we can make, right now, is for Real Inner Peace. The peace of a painfully and patiently stoic Promethean Rock...Which must appear also to be in this ugly world, for so many of us, the Transcendence of a troubled Cross.But that for us is The Only Way, the Only Truth and the Only Life.And that way Works.Roquentin\u2019s doesn\u2019t.We must Accept, and NOT Eternally Reject the Truth.",
            "The protagonist is a captive of loneliness and time.This sun and blue sky were only a snare. This is the hundredth time I've let myself be caught. My memories are like coins in the devil's purse: when you open it you find only dead leaves.For him there are no expectations and no changes in life\u2026 The world passes him by\u2026I can no longer distinguish present from future and yet it lasts, it happens little by little\u2026So the protagonist becomes nauseated with reality and his purposeless existence turns into a mental torment. I was just thinking that here we sit, all of us, eating and drinking to preserve our precious existence and really there is nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.It comes as no surprise, however\u2026 Even God couldn\u2019t find out a reason for his existence: \u201cAnd God said unto Moses, I am that I am,\u201d Exodus 3:14.There is a paradox though: Why bother? If existence is meaningless then any philosophy is useless\u2026",
            "Originally published in 1938, Jean-Paul Sartre's short existential novel La Naus\u00e9e can be read on many levels - to list several: philosophical, psychological, social and political. Going back to my college days, my reading of this work has always been decidedly personal. Thus my observations below and, at points, my own experiences relating to certain passages I have found to contain great power. Then the Nausea sized me",
            "SOME OF THESE DAYSDisegno di Alberto Giacometti.Libro letto nel momento giusto, quando il termine e la categoria \u2018esistenzialismo\u2019 me li sarei potuti scrivere sulle t-shirt, o in fronte.Leggo che l'editore Gallimard chiese a Sartre di cambiare il titolo, da \u201cMelancholia\u201d a \u201cLa nausea\u201d, giudicando il primo poco attraente per i lettori. Una bella lotta.Altrettanto buffo \u00e8 che Sartre abbia sentito il bisogno di un impianto tanto classico. Perch\u00e9, anche se lo fa dichiarare ai suoi editori, l\u2019espediente che avvia il romanzo \u00e8 per l\u2019appunto un super classico: manoscritto ritrovato, diario di un certo Roquentin, che s\u2019\u00e8 ritirato a vivere in provincia per fare ricerche su un tizio del secolo XVIII, tale marchese di Rollebon.Alberto Giacometti: Annette.Oltre Roquentin, che parla in prima persona, s\u2019incontra qualche altro personaggio degno di nota, pochi a dir il vero. Su tutti, l\u2019Autodidatta che Roquentin incrocia in biblioteca: l\u2019Autodidatta \u00e8 intento a leggere, e possibilmente, imparare lo scibile umano seguendo l\u2019ordine alfabetico. Bell\u2019impresa.Appare anche un compositore musicale ebreo e una cantante di colore, Some of These Days \u00e8 la sua canzone.Sotto forma di diario, racconti, soprattutto pensieri e riflessioni, sul senso della vita, che senso non ha, sulla solitudine, sull\u2019angoscia. Mal di vivere.La Nausea non \u00e8 in me: io la sento laggi\u00f9 sul muro, sulle bretelle, dappertutto attorno a me. Fa tutt\u2019uno col caff\u00e8, son io che sono in essa.Lungo la strada ce n\u2019\u00e8 per tutto e tutti, dio, ovviamente, borghesi, benpensanti, conformisti, la stupidit\u00e0 umana\u2026Alberto Giacometti: Studio per un ritratto di James Lord.Inizia riportando anche la data, la prima \u00e8 Luned\u00ec, 29 gennaio 1932. Ma presto rimangono solo i giorni della settimana, a rimarcare l\u2019inutilit\u00e0 del tutto, l\u2019inconsistenza dell\u2019esistere.A un certo punto si legge, semplicemente:Marted\u00ecNiente. Esistito.L\u2019inferno, sono gli altri.",
            "Third time lucky...I have always preferred the work of Albert Camus when it comes to the subject of 'existentialism'. It has taken me three attempts to read Nausea to finally appreciate. Whereas I just found Camus easier to digest immediately. This small novel is no doubt an important work and essential reading for philosophical purposes. I remember reading Camus's 'The Stranger and Sartre's Nausea back to back, similar in some ways, not in others, The Stranger lingered for weeks, Nausea drifted away. But for whatever reason, this time around things just clicked. Maybe it helped reading 'The Age of Reason' to finally grasp him, the fact I am a fan of Simone de Beauvoir should mean looking at Sartre in a better light, after all he took her under his wing during her creative days at university. They enjoyed each others company, and this goes to show men and women can become great friends without becoming lovers. Sartre, writer and philosophy professor has certainly embedded himself in literary history, and would say he could have been viewed as the French Kafka by virtue of his gift for expressing the horror of certain intellectual situations, if it weren\u2019t that his ideas, unlike those of the author of \u201cThe Great Wall of China,\u201d were not completely foreign to moral problems. Kafka always questioned the meaning of life. Sartre only questions the fact of existence, which is an order of reality much more immediate than the human and social elaborations of the life that is on this side of life.\u201cNausea,\u201d the journal of Antoine Roquentin, is the novel of absolute solitude, a solitude that made me feel uncomfortable. It is a question here of nothing but the spiritual results of solitude. They are analyzed with a rigor of thought and expression that will no doubt seem intolerable to most readers. Now I see the light, a philosophical novelist of the first order. Since Voltaire, we know that in France the philosophical novel has been a light genre, not far from the fable. Sartre\u2019s literature bears no relation to this frivolous genre, but it gives a very good idea of what a literature associated to an existentialist philosophy might be. The law of the man who is rigorously alone is not the fear of nothingness, but the fear of existence. This discovery takes us far.If his first novel was a work without a solution, by which I mean that it no more opens up any solutions for the universe than the principal works of Dostoevsky, it would perhaps be a singular success without a successor. But with its final pages \u201cNausea\u201d is not a book without a solution. Jean-Paul Sartre who throughout the novel paints a portrait of a great bourgeois city of social caricature, and has gifts as a novelist that are too precise and too cruel not to result in great denunciations, not to completely open up into reality, a reality I would rather not see.A seminal work that I will come to appreciate even more over the space of time.",

Captured by the Russian army during World War II and convicted of being a Vatican spy, American Jesuit Father Walter J. Ciszek spent some 23 agonizing years in Soviet prisons and the labor camps of Siberia. He here recalls how it was only through an utter reliance on God's will that he managed to endure. He tells of the courage he found in prayer-a courage that eased the loneliness, the pain, the frustrations, the anguish, the fears, the despair. For, as Ciszek relates, the solace of spiritual contemplation gave him an inner serenity upon which he was able to draw amidst the arrogance of evil that surrounded him. Learning to accept even the inhuman work of toiling in the infamous Siberian salt mines as a labor pleasing to God, he was able to turn adverse forces into a source of positive value and a means of drawing closer to the compassionate and never-forsaking Divine Spirit. He Leadeth Me is a book to inspire all Christians to greater faith and trust in God-even in their darkest hour.",

            "Rereading again for a class I'm giving our school's teachers on this amazing man...I can scarcely recommend a better read for this Year of Faith than Fr. Walter Ciszek\u2019s follow-on to his autobiographical  With God in Russia.  He Leadeth Me is the book Fr. Ciszek wanted to write the first time, that is, it\u2019s his spiritual journey as opposed to the factual story of his years spent behind the Iron Curtain, much of it in Siberia in labor camps, prisons and poor villages usually not serving openly as a priest\u2014his faith constantly tested. If your faith has ever been \u2013 or is currently being \u2013 challenged this book will inspire you beyond anything you can imagine.The first eight chapters\u2014approximately eighty pages\u2014outline Fr. Ciszek\u2019s initial assignment in Poland, trek into Russia, ordeal with the Soviet authorities, and deportation to Siberia. After that, although the book continues to follow Father\u2019s almost unbelievable escape from one hostile situation after another, it is arranged in chapters with titles like: The Body, Faith, The Priesthood, Work, Humility, Freedom, The Kingdom of God, Humanity and The Fear of Death. This arrangement allows the book to be read either as a piece or selectively according to a chapter heading which you might want to refer to or reference for talk, research paper or your own spiritual benefit.Easily one of the 100 best books I\u2019ve read in my life and one which I will return to often! READ IT! ",
            "One might think that the advice of a Jesuit missionary priest who served over 20 years in Soviet prisons to laypeople dealing with their own struggles might run something like, You don't have it quite so bad. On the contrary",
            "Father Ciszek's memoir of his imprisonment in the Soviet Union makes for compelling reading. His recounting of the continuing faith of Christians in the face of daunting persecution was inspiring. Especially impactful was the willingness of the men in hard labor camps, already grossly underfed, to fast when they had a chance to have communion. ",
            "ENGLISH: Impressive account of the imprisonment of a Jesuit priest in the Soviet Union, where he travelled to impart spiritual help to displaced Polish workers. Accused of being a Vatican spy, he spent four years in Lubyanka, eleven in labor camps in Siberia, and a few more, already free, but pushed from town to town, in Siberia. Finally he was exchanged for several Soviet spies and was able to return to his native country (the United States).This man managed to accept his sufferings, which he always interpreted as God's will for his life. Back in the USA, he has written his books to give testimony of his faith.The account of his captivity reminds me a lot of Solzhenitsyn's novel The First Circle",
            "My best religious book after the bible. I LOVE it and I keep reading it over and over. Highly recommended ",
            "Fr. Ciszek's account of his imprisonment in Russia, how he managed to survive, and what he learned about God is astonishing. In his own words: I felt that I had learned much during those years of hardship and suffering that could be of help to others in their lives. For every man's life contains its share of suffering",
            "THis book is AMAZING and I have to be honest: I will need to read this again to take it all in. It's the spiritual memoir of a priest who ended up behind the Iron Curtain at a time when it was extremely dangerous to be a priest in the Soviet Union. He ended up getting arrested, spending five years in solitary confinement enduring interrogations, was forced to sign a fraudulent confession, and then spent fifteen years in the Siberian labor camps. This book documents not the what of his survival as much as the how of his faith life and the things he learned during those years.And there are parts so intense that I will have to read this book again in order to feel I really get it all. His insights into participating with God's will are incredible.",

            "http://www.rantingdragon.com/review-o...Shadowdale was first published in 1989 as the leading novel in The Avatar Trilogy, arguably one of the most significant series of Realms novels in terms of their effect on the setting. It was written under the pseudonym Richard Awlinson, which I always believed was to protect the actual authors (Troy Denning and Scott Ciencin) from the ensuing fallout. Shadowdale begins the tale of the fall of the Gods of the Realms. Chaos, destruction, and death abound as the Gods themselves walk the earth in mortal shells.Even the Gods have GodsThe premise of the story is this: the Gods and Goddesses of the Forgotten Realms themselves answer to an over-being called Ao. Ao summons all of the deities into his presence and informs them that the Tablets of Fate (which define and describe the individual duties of each deity) have been stolen, and their juvenile jockeying for power, instead of managing the world as they should have, has disappointed their master. As punishment, Ao forces them all into human bodies and casts them down to the Realms to, I guess, learn humility or something.Naturally, they just continue their juvenile scheming and jockeying for power. This leads to a number of, frankly, ridiculous changes to the existing structure of Forgotten Realms geography, religion, magic, you name it. We\u2019re talking dead Gods, mortals elevated to Godhood, the introduction of \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cwild\u201d magic zones in the world, earthquakes, floods, and all the good bible stuff. It\u2019s such a fundamental change to so many things, done so early in the life of the setting that it makes one wonder just what TSR was thinking.Some compelling charactersMajor plot element aside, here\u2019s the actual meat of this story: the adventures of a very typical D&D party (composed of a fighter, cleric, mage, and thief, exactly how D&D was designed) are actually quite good. As much as I may disagree in isolation about the changes that were made to the Realms in this book, watching these characters deal with something as significant as Gods walking the earth was very engaging. They all have their own problems going on, were thrust together more by circumstance than choice, and experience plenty of conflicts among themselves; all this combined made for some really great storytelling.One of the two most interesting characters is the party fighter, Kelemvor Lyonsbane, who suffers from one of the most original curses I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Some early ancestor of his was a greedy jerk who fell afoul of some gypsies (as you do) who cursed him (as they do) such that he could only ever engage in selfless acts without any desire for compensation or reward. If he ever did something for his own profit, he would transform into a werebeast and kill people. However, somewhere down the line, the terms of the curse flipped around. Kelemvor can ONLY do things for his own personal selfish benefit. He needs to put a price on everything, and do nothing for the sake of the act. It makes for some really amazing scenes when the group is basically trying to save the world, and he\u2019s trying to negotiate a price for it.The other great character is the party thief Cyric. He\u2019s the best kind of burgeoning villain. Pragmatic rather than malevolent, he believes what he sees and not much else. He\u2019s cynical, suspicious, and rational. One of the early introductory bits of history about Cyric involves him directly facing the Goddess Tymora, to whom he did not tithe a proper amount of gold. When asked whether or not he believes in her, and whether that is why he would not sacrifice to her, the response is basically, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a goddess, you don\u2019t deserve my gold; if you are a goddess you have no need for it, so why bother?\u201d In a world like the Realms where the supernatural is so commonplace, the logic and rationality is actually quite refreshing. Cyric becomes a much larger fixture in the history of the Realms as a result of actions that occur during this trilogy, and giving him such a relateable grounding helps establish him later in the series.Some strong opinionsThe Avatar Trilogy turned out to be something of a polarizer for fans of the Forgotten Realms. It was once suggested to me by a source who will remain nameless that many of the changes these books made to the setting were done without much consulting with the other authors; a few works in progress had to be changed if not all but scrapped to account for the new state of things. This is where my almost certainly false idea about why the book was published under a pseudonym originates. It was also the catalyst for plenty of questions for various authors and other TSR staff at conventions for a few years following the publication of the series.As a lifelong reader of the Forgotten Realms, I don\u2019t like a lot of what happened in this book and this trilogy. It just pushed so much existing lore out the window and replaced it for evidently no necessary reason. This is a lot like retconning a series to make a future mistake into truth. Instead they seem to be suggesting that they\u2019d screwed up somewhere in earlier works and wanted to reset the world more to their liking, but the changes they went with remain very strange to me.Why should you read this book?If you enjoy epic fantasy without necessarily having to slog through 10+ books and thousands of pages, this is a great book for you. The whole trilogy is only about 1000 pages end to end and all done in the classic action-oriented realms style that made it so popular. Not to mention, you have Gods battling over cities, magic going awry throughout the world, and an intrepid band of heroes facing impossible odds to try and save the world from utter destruction.It also serves as one of the more integral \u201crealms history\u201d books in the catalogue. So much changes with how the Realms function as a result of this series that in order to really understand a lot of events of later works, you need to understand what happened during this time. Many elements are referenced only obliquely from here on out, and if you don\u2019t read it here, you might find certain things confusing or hard to follow down the road.Whether you like, dislike or don\u2019t care about the changes these books made to the setting, they are inarguably among the most important and impacting entries in the Forgotten Realms bibliography.",
            "Novelising the move from 1st to 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons24 March 2012\tBack in 1989 it was decided by TSR that it was well and truly time to reinvigorate the AD&D system, and to be honest it was sorely needed. The gave was about 20 years old at this stage and it had been evolving continuously with more complex and complicated rules being forever thrown on top of the pre-existing ones. The original game has come out as what was then known as the basic set, and had then moved onto more advanced rules. In describing these rules as advanced the better description would be complex and incredibly clunky. As such, in their infinite wisdom, TSR decided that a complete rewrite of the rules was needed, and thus out came 2nd edition (and every ten years since they have moved to further upgrade the rules, though I must admit that I am still quite happy with 3rd edition).\tHowever, due to the extensive changes and reworking of the rules, the creators decided that they needed to bring in a huge change to the worlds as well, and at this stage the standard AD&D world was The Forgotten Realms. Thus they created a world wide event that would coincide with the new rules, and the result was a series of three novels and a series of three adventures dealing with the period that has come to be known as 'The Time of Troubles'.\tThe story is about a couple of the evil gods who decide to steal an artifact which in turn angered the great god Ao. As a result all of the gods were cast out of the heavens and into the Realms as punishment and were to wonder around until the culprit stepped forward (which, being evil gods, they did not). As the gods wondered around the world they, as can be expected, came into conflict with each other, as well as setting themselves up in their favourite spots. Some of them even died, though there was a catch \u2013 if a god dies, they die quite spectacularly, and usually in the form of a nuclear explosion.\tThis was not going to leave the people of the Realms safe, because not only do they have these gods wondering around, but all of the magic has gone completely haywire, so as it turns out (surprise, surprise) a group of adventurers decide to go off and attempt to solve this problem. In the Realms, if a solution to a problem is needed, then one travels to visit Elminster, which is what the adventurers do, and which is why this story is called Shadowdale (namely because that is where Elminster lives).\tI will continue my discussion about the series when I move on to the next book in the series, and will discuss my thoughts on this particular trilogy upon reaching the third one. Needless to say, I will flag at this point that I would not be recommending this trilogy to anybody: it is a simple waste of time and energy and was written purely to provide a bridge between 1st and 2nd edition AD&D. While it may have been fun at the time, currently, as far as I am concerned, 20 years after the event that triggered these novels, they are pretty much obsolete and really only for those die hard Dungeons & Dragons fans who want a bit of nostalgia, and even then there are much better books out there than these ones.",
            "The Forgotten Realms are in a state of monumental upheaval.

Ve\u0107 po klasi\u010dnom obrascu FRP igara stvara se dru\u017eina junaka koja \u0107e krenuti u misiju pronalaska izgubljenih Tablica. Dru\u017einu \u010dine ratnik Kelemvor Lyonsbane, sve\u0107enik Adon od Sune, \u010darobnica Midnight i redovnik Cyric. Kako je Midnight bila obdarena darom Mystre, bo\u017eice magije, na njezin nagovor, s junacima kre\u0107e prvo do prvo nebeskog stepeni\u0161ta gdje bogovi uvide da je povratak na Nebesa za njih zatvoren zauvijek. Tu misija ne staje jer si junaci uzimaju za cilj vratiti ponovno mir u Faerun i bogove na nebesa. A u tome \u0107e im pomo\u0107i mag Elminster. Magija u tim vremenima je nestabilna i avatari Bogova hodaju zemljom. Glavni antagonisti su Bane, bog rata i Myrkul, bog mrtvih.Pravo fantasy d\u017eepno izdanje s dobrom i te\u010dnom pri\u010dom, zanimljivim likovima, akcijom, preobratima i fino spredanom mitologijom u pozadini. Samo me podsjetilo koliko fantasy znam biti dobar. Strijelac je propao prije negoli je dovr\u0161io trilogiju, a kamoli pentologiju... Dajem peticu, ne samo zbog nostalgije, nego zbog toga koliko predivnih svjetova je ljudska ma\u0161ta sposobna osmisliti. Ah jo\u0161 jednom...",
            "Oy, beyond oy, vae and gevalt! I came across this paperback, in near-mint condition, on a used paperback rack at a gas station somewhere in Kansas. I thought I had scored a find. But...well, this story is awful. Pace is about the only thing it has going for it. Both dialogue and narrative are a hodgepodge of fantasy genre tropes and gender equality posturing that is shallow enough to be an insulting facade. The plot is no better. The characters are all inconsistent and bipolar, randomly doing and feeling things with no discernible motive whatsoever (apart from exposition, I mean.) The protagonists are unsympathetic and without depth. The main antagonist comes across as someone straight out of a 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. I counted no less than three glaring instances of deus ex machina. It is also never a good thing when game mechanics can be discerned throughout a story; this one doesn't even try to hide them. The author even name-drops several spells, straight out of the AD&D 2d Edition Player's Handbook! This story could have been so much more than it is. At least none of the protagonists is a Mary Sue...",
            "This book tries to be two things at once. Fortunately, it does one of those things very well: it is a fun action romp that gets you interested in the setting and makes you want to play the D&D adventure of the same name (circa 1988). Unfortunately, it does a fairly poor job of being the first installment of an epic fantasy involving world-changing events. The real let-down, however, is that it fails to even be a serviceable fantasy jaunt with believable character development and an unbroken plot. While the author does a good job of making you believe the world is in chaos and gets you hooked into the characters, he just let's the ball roll downhill once it gets going. Character motivations are one dimensional, as are the cardboard cut-out RPG archetype characters. The most developed backstory is that of Kelemvor, and its such a heavy handed element that the author all but asks for forgiveness for making him act in a completely unbelievable manor. We also must suffer through a journey of rapid character development so unwarranted the characters themselves seem confused by their actions. To make this worse what seems like a few days as you read the book ends up being a journey that spans a month! I won't spoil anything, but suffice it to say the ending of this book is nothing more than a set of contrived excuses to top it off with a large amount of action and makes you feel like everything you read before this should have been squeezed into a prologue. For a trilogy that is supposed to cover one of the most ground-breaking events in the history of the Forgotten Realms, Shadowdale feels too much like a junior high D&D game transcript to do the backstory justice.",
            "My love for fantasy fiction was truly challenged with this offering by Richard Awlinson (Pen name for Scott Ciencin). Shadowdale: Book One of The Avatar Trilogy is difficult to review because there was so much I disliked. I'm still unsure why I finished reading it - and because I finished it, I gave it two stars. And as hard as it is, I'll try to evoke the past and replay some of it to write a proper review.Ao, the Maker of All Things, informs without warning, a handful of lesser gods that the Tablets of Fate have been stolen and he's holding them responsible - as well as having been 'a millennium of disappointment'. Ao banishes these lesser gods to the Realms where they were previously worshiped so they may live as a human. Ao transforms them into mystical lights that must find and possess a human.From there on, we have an enormous story, so enormous I felt the author was having difficulty controlling and conveying it to the reader. There were many characters, gods and humans and worshipers alike and none of them was interesting or well-written. They are often referred to, not by name but by an attribute.The Realms meanwhile had magic but it was made unstable by the fall of these gods. The fallen gods, however, possessing humans, still possess quite a bit of their previous godly skills - and still they prove to be extremely incompetent.The four so-called heroes were not heroic and I wasn't drawn to any of them or their purposes. Nothing seemed to matter but getting to the end of this book. Pretty sure I'll not read the rest of the trilogy although I hear from some that the third book is better.",
            "Well, I made two other attempts to get started on this book in the past and found it fairly dull but I guess I just needed to give it some more time to get started. So far so good, but it would be a bit more interesting if it wouldn't follow the standard TSR books formula of character introduction, a monster fight, character development, monster fight, character development, monster fight ad nauseum. Did I mention the monster fights just kind of happen ... seemingly they're thrown in after the story is written to break up annoying things like dialog and plot progression.Not a terrible book, and it is growing on me. Hopefully I can make it through the next two books of the Avatar Trilogy.Now that I've finished it, I found the final two or three chapters more exciting, what with there being a big battle and all. I'm still giving it two stars due to the cardboard cutout characters with secrets syndrome this book seems afflicted with, and it's uncanny ability to go for what seems like several pages without any actual dialog. Finally, in the very last paragraph of the book, what seemed to me like a really unnecessary cliffhanger occurred. Perhaps I'll find out if this anything to do with the overall plot arc in the next book of the trilogy - Tantras.",
            "After hearing so much about this trilogy, I came to it with (probably unreasonably) high expectations, and was definitely let down.The only really good parts of this book involve Cyric, his interactions with other characters, and his internal struggles. Kelemvor is interesting, but the clumsy writing often makes him come across as a stupid brute that's incapable of thinking outside the box.Most everything else is quite heavy-handed. Descriptions are often crude, transitions abrupt, characters rather one-dimensional, and the entire atmosphere quite juvenile. Powerful characters like Bane, Mystra, and Elminster succumb to anime-isms, and by that I mean: they're SO POWERFUL that the only way to break them is for things to get EVEN MORE DRAMATIC AND POWERFUL. This is a frustrating and eye-roll inducing way of writing, and unfortunately became tiring very quickly.Interestingly, the god's avatars are generally decent characters, and reasonably well-portrayed if, again, clumsily. The ending was poor enough that it has almost put me off reading the second entry, and the book in general dragged so much that it took quite some time to get around to finishing.All that said, it's still worth reading...once, to get some sense of atmosphere around the Time of Troubles.",
            "It's hard going back and reading these first books in the Forgotten Realms setting. I'm trying to judge these books based off my current reading and not factor in that this is the infantile stage of the world. These first books are classics, without doubt, but reading them today, they're just not that good. They rely too much on the gaming aspect. I do like the premise of this series however.As of now I am continuing to read from the beginning of Forgotten Realms, and stuck in 1989.Next up is the 2nd book in this series Tantras.",
            "Storia potenzialmente molto interessante, ma sviluppata in maniera non molto convincente. I personaggi del party principale sono ben caratterizzati, ma ogni tanto la storia s'incaglia in momenti di stanca, per poi ripartire all'improvviso di slancio. Ottima invece \u00e8 la battaglia finale alle porte di Shadowdale.",
            "No esperaba mucho de esta novela y el resultado ha sido peor. Sin contar la mala traducci\u00f3n que empa\u00f1a todo el libro, nos encontramos ante un grupo de adolescentes hormonados en cuerpos de adultos queriendo salvar el mundo. La historia no es muy all\u00e1, los personajes son muy planos y el final es una chorrada. Si eres un rolero intensito de 15 a\u00f1os te flipara en colores.",
            "This was a pretty good story. It was a little rushed or short in some parts, but overall was a good read.",
            "If I read books like this all the time, I'm pretty sure the review that follows would become repetitive. It may well apply to all cheap paperback fantasies. I admit though, not having read anything like this since I was in seventh grade, I am out of touch with the genre.This book seems geared towards seventh grade boys who sit apart and read it at recess while the other kids play basketball or talk to girls. Don't get me wrong, these boys are important people: safekeepers of the imagination and a long tradition of heroic fantasy adventure. Forgive the blanket sexism; I think it's true. In any case, books like Shadowdale may well be gateways to the great sophistication of Tolkien or GRR Martin, or perhaps the life of a reader in general. It's easy to read, and not terribly written, and you may enjoy it if a) you are immune to the painful cliche of the D and D adventure story, b) you have five or so hours to waste, and c) you have never read a good book in your life, except maybe To Kill a Mockingbird in your seventh grade English class (and you were uninterested). The second factor (b) above was certainly true for me over the past four days.But really, I'm glad I read this. It brings me back to the books I used to love so much as an adolescent. I really have no problem with it. It was almost fun to read.Not bad. Not too bad... Not too bad at all.",
            "There is a very good chance that this book - and really the entire of my Forgotten Realms shelf - is the ultimate example of why I'm shelving books as I was young and dumb",
            "Entretenida y bien escrita. Sorprende la cantidad de pasajes surrealistas y algo m\u00e1s inquietantes de lo habitual en esta clase de novela. Por momentos, la trama no es tan f\u00e1cil de seguir. Me ha hecho pasar el rato y no me arrepiento, pero buscaba algo m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sico.",
            "Oh my God it was so bad. Badly written, and the translation's even worse (the French edition also cut off large portions of this book. I'm still debating wether it's a good thing or no. On one hand, it can't be good on a stylistic point of view; on the other hand, that means I was done with this quicker)Maybe it would have helped to know the Forgotten Realms settings beforehand, because it was full of names and references I sure didn't get. And the interesting stuff - the dude cursed to never work for free, for instance - is buried under poor writing style and even poorer characterization. The sense of wonder I could almost feel (fantasy in the 80s was about escapism, after all, and it's something current fantasy seems to have shunned away, which is a pity) would have granted it another star...if the whole book wasn't so mind-numbingly boring.",
            " I feel like this book seems a lot like The End of War and how it transitions between different stories but then it stops at around chapter 5-6. After chapters 5-6 the characters join together and start to go on adventures to stop multiple things. One of the adventures is how they went to the dungeons to go and take this one thing that aided them on their help. But I feel like this a book for people who like medieval times",

            "This book reads like a freshmen in high school English wrote it.I have had this book sitting on my shelf for at least 10 plus years.I always struggled to get past the first few chapters. I finally got the motivation to read it, and disappointed to say some of the writing and grammar really made this book hard to read and not as fun as it should have been. The elements of a good story and a good D&D campaign are there. However, in terms of writing this book needed some more work.",
            "It's finally over ! The story could have been good if only the lore and characters were developed. Everything felt one dimensional and unrefined, like I was missing parts of the story. The love story between kelemvor and minuit makes no sense. He barely talked to her and insulted her instead, and suddenly she thinks he's hot and they kind of fall in love except he sleeps with the first other hot girl he meets ? Also why were women in this book either described as a literal child or as a sex bomb ? The misogyny ain't cute honestly."

THe teacher did not know what punishment to give.So the teacher got an idea to calm them down. The teacher's idea was to tell her students that The famous Nick Thompson was her husband.After several days the students were so exited that they didn't belive that Nick was the teacher's husband. So the teacher asked him if Nick could come to their school. The next day the famous Nick Thompsan came to school. The students couldn't belive their eyes. They promised to the teacher that they will behave well the next few days. But how long would it last?Septembre 26 2014Aftery reading 30 more pages a lot of of cool things happend.The behaivior got from good to bad because Nick Thompson made a kind of contest that would make people challenge there selves. The contest was about telling someone a joke and making them laugh so hard that milk would come out. So Katie the pro joker made a joke that made Nick Thompson laugh so hard that milk came out of his nose. Then the principal scram at him and he had to leave.My 2 favorite parts of this are is one when Nick changed the behaivior because of a stupid contest. An example would when he challenged people to maake some kind of joke and they if they someone else or Nick milk fall of their nose. My second favorite part was when Katie the pro said the joke and made Nick Thompson the famous guy milk fall out of his nose. Then when Katie did that, people called her the queen.October 9 2014 A lot of exciting things have happened since I read The Fruit Bowl Project.The teacher gave everyone a punishment. The punishment was to make a rap about jokes. At first first students thought it would be fun, but when Katie presented her rap, she got humilliated.The rap was based on the joke Katie said to Nick Thompsen which made milk come out of their nose. After the last presentation the teacher was about to sign them another rap. But Katie and Jason appoligise to the teacher. Then the whole class did the same and the teacher didn't assign them home work.What I liked about the past 50 pages was when the teacher assigned them a rap and everyone thoght it was fun. But after Katie's presentaion everyone knew how terrifying it was. I also think that the teacher wanted some revenge so that is why she assigned them a rap. Katie was the only one who did it in the first day but it didn't turn out well. It took Katie five secondes to realize that her friend's were making fun of her. Overall this book was great and fun to read.",
            "This book was disappointing. When I read the synopsis, I envisioned a story about young kids creating original pieces of literature and getting those pieces published. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I felt as if I was too old to be reading this book. Surely it is children's literature, but as I read I continued to set it aside to donate. Every minute I read out of this novel, I lost one IQ point. Seriously, it was that young.Also, I disliked the point of view from which it was written. I could hardly remember all of the different characters and their stories because the point of view changed after about two paragraphs. The actual Fruit Bowl Project took up about two-thirds of the book itself. Can you understand my frustration?The only relevant sections of the entire novel were the very beginning (about the first eighteen pages) and the end (from page forty-seven to the very end). Everything in between is irrelevant and tiresome. I would give it to my little sister to read",

He uses a bowl of fruit as analogy about style and that launches a creative writing project so compelling that kids who weren't even in that class end up contributing. A fun way to talk about style and point of view with budding writers. a quick read- the story is really only 46 pages long",

Said rock star doesn't talk to them about being a rock star, but the importance of writing, and tasks them with The Fruit Bowl Project. The students have to write a story about a series of established facts. The variable is how it is written - poetry",

It\u2019s a fine quick little read, but the first half of the book that\u2019s set-up doesn\u2019t really have that much connection to the meat of the premise, or the variations on a theme. It\u2019s also fairly tedious to read through all the different versions of the story when they\u2019re not terribly inventive (the crazy genres and the math versions worked better for me here than interminable POVs.)

The Mayan serpent symbol was a real stretch -- a contrivance that didn't add any interest to the story for me. I usually really like Wallace, but not this time.

            "Edgar Wallace has a fertile imagination when it comes to exploring the depravity of the human species. Like most of his books that I've read so far, this tale is a bit convoluted but still rather gripping. I actually had less trouble than normal keeping track of all the various characters, but I've learned that it pays to take notes whilst reading Wallace. Fortunately, with a kindle doing so is a breeze. So, we have ace reporter, Peter Dewin. He is following the trail of some crimes or potential crimes marked by the leaving of a card with a drawing of a feathered serpent on it. Some folks are getting these cards, and although they deny any understanding of the figure, they are none-the-less terrorized by having received said cards. One is Ella Creed, a famous actress. Another Leicester Crewe, a stock trader. Then there's Joe Farmer, who is a boxing promoter and someone who used to run a pub. Finally, we have Paula Staines, a woman who does very fine black and white drawings. What could be the connection, if any, between them, and why are they getting the feathered serpent cards? Are they warnings of some kind. Well, to learn more about feathered serpents, Dewin tracks down Gregory Beale, who is an archeologist/philanthropist, lately returned from a decade in Central America, or so he intimates anyway. Apparently, feathered serpents feature strongly in the mythology of the Maya and Aztec cultures. Beale has just hired Daphne Olroyd to be his private secretary. She had previously worked for Leicester Crewe. Dewin had met Ms. Olroyd at a restaurant and had almost immediately fallen in love with her. So, how does that all work out? Oh yeah, there is a mysterious William Lane, who was alleged to have been released from prison recently, but who apparently was killed by a car in an accident outside a house he and two of his companions were in the process of burgling. But, one of the former companions thinks he has seen Lane. Is it a ghost, or did Lane not die, despite there being a death certificate attesting that he had? How does that work? And so forth. It's an entertaining yarn with which to while away these dreary days of waiting for spring through endless dank days of drizzle. ",
            "Quaint and old-fashioned, with a hugely complex plot about secret societies and counterfeit money. It's delightful because of its multiple layers and twists. Wallace, according to the back cover, wrote 175 novels, 24 plays and there have been 160 films based on his novels. He died in Hollywood in 1932 while working on the screenplay for King Kong."

First published in 1949 and praised in The New York Times Book Review as \"full of beauty and vigor and bite,\" A Sand County Almanac combines some of the finest nature writing since Thoreau with an outspoken and highly ethical regard for America's relationship to the land. The volume includes a section on the monthly changes of the Wisconsin countryside; another section that gathers together the informal pieces written by Leopold over a forty-year period as he traveled around the woodlands of Wisconsin, Iowa, Arizona, Sonora, Oregon, Manitoba, and elsewhere; and a final section in which Leopold addresses more formally the philosophical issues involved in wildlife conservation. As the forerunner of such important books as Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire, and Robert Finch's The Primal Place, this classic work remains as relevant today as it was forty years ago.",

            "How is it possible that I earned a BS in natural resources (and slipping toward an MS in wildlife) without being required to read this book? Aldo Leopold is often called the father of wildlife management. But Sand County Almanac is not a text book, with nary a glossary, set of models, or flow chart within its pages. It does contain some pretty drawings, and some spellbinding imagery. Leopold goes beyond vividly describing a scene of chopping wood or canoeing a river; he pans back to ecological connectivity or the aesthetic importance of the natural world to humanity. He talks about the need for a land ethic, and it sounds very logical and obvious-- I have to remind myself that he wrote these essays before such a mindset was commonplace. Even if his views were not completely original for the time, he is undoubtedly remembered for being so darn eloquent. A master of the one-liner, it's no wonder that all of my nat res classes seemed to quote him several times each semester (and some classes on a weekly basis). I feel sheepish for not reading it much earlier in my career, but I'm very glad I picked it up. He was a remarkable naturalist and writer. I can see him clearly, squatting in ice-crusted mud before dawn breaks over the marsh, his shotgun poking through the reeds and ears open to the sounds of approaching waterfowl, all the while silently creating poetry.",

Today it continues to sell about 40,000 copies a year, though apparently that was not enough or perhaps influential enough readers to stop the tide he saw rising as early as the middle of the nineteenth century, where shortsighted American corporate greed and consequent rapacious environmental destruction triumphed over what he called a \u201cland ethic,\u201d or a responsible relationship existing between people and the land they inhabit. \u201cThere are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.\u201dLeopold knew that most Americans look at beautiful natural places and think profit:\u201cTo those devoid of imagination a blank place on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part.\u201d But he writes with a deeper appreciation of that beauty:\u201cOur ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty. It expands through successive stages of the beautiful to values as yet uncaptured by language.\u201d Leopold loves art and music but worries that people might value art in a museum and music from a symphony more than the Colorado Rockies or \u201cgeese music.\u201d People, Leopold knew even then, are cut off from nature, couldn\u2019t name as he does lovingly and knowingly the plants and animals that are around them, nor see how crucial they are to our survival on the planet; as Wordsworth said:The world is too much with us; late and soon,Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;\u2014Little we see in Nature that is ours;We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! Leopold thinks that we went wrong when we decided to teach chemistry in school but not ecological ethics along with it. Maybe he wouldn't be so sad about the damage already done to the environment in the forties when he wrote this. But because was one of the few educated to know it, he felt isolated: \u201cOne of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.\u201d The marks of death he was observing closely",
            "Our ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty.*-pause-Our ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty. It expands through successive stages of the beautiful to values as yet uncaptured by language. The quality of cranes lies, I think, in this higher gamut, as yet beyond the reach of words.There is nothing, nothing, beyond Aldo Leopold's reach of words. I've read, oh, sixty or seventy books so far this year - some inventive, some incisive - but nothing matches the magic of this writing. And so, I'll have to quote a lot.Acts of creation are ordinarily reserved for gods and poets, but humbler folks may circumvent this restriction if they know how. To plant a pine, for example, one need be neither god nor poet; one need only own a shovel. By virtue of this curious loophole in the rules, any clodhopper may say : Let there be a tree--and there will be one. . . . God passed on his handiwork as early as the seventh day, but I notice He has been rather noncommittal about its merits. I gather either He spoke too soon, or that trees stand more looking upon than do fig leaves and firmaments. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --There are other plants who seem to ask of this world not riches but room. Such is the little sandwort that throws a white-lace cap over the poorest hilltops just before the lupines splash them with blue. Sandworts simply refuse to live on a a good farm, even on a very good farm, complete with rock garden and begonias. And then there is the little Linaria, so small, so slender, and so blue that you don't even see it until it is directly underfoot; who ever saw a Linaria except on a sandblow? . . . There are birds that are found only in the Sand Counties, for reasons sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, to guess. The clay-colored sparrow is there, for the clear reason that he is enamored of jackpines, and jackpines of sand. The sandhill crane is there, for the clear reason that he is enamored of solitude, and there is none left elsewhere. But why do woodcocks prefer to nest in sandy regions? Their preference is rooted in no such mundane matter as food, for earthworms are far more abundant on better soils. After years of study, I now think I know the reason. The male woodcock, while doing his preening prologue to the sky dance, is like a short lady in high heels: he does not show up to advantage in dense tangled ground cover. But on the poorest sand-streak of the poorest pasture or meadow of the Sand Counties, there is, in April at least, no ground cover at all, save only moss, Draba, cardamine, sheep-sorrel, and Antennaria, all negligible imprediments to a bird with short legs. Here the male woodcock can puff and strut and mince, not only without let or hindrance, but in full view of his audience, real or hoped-for. This little circumstance, important for only an hour a day, for only one month of the year, perhaps for only one of the two sexes, and certainly wholly irrelevant to economic standards of living, determine the woodcock's choice of home. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --For one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun. The Cro-Magnon who slew the the last mammoth thought only of steaks. The sportsman who shot the last pigeon thought only of his prowess. The sailor who clubbed the last auk thought of nothing at all. But we, who have lost our pigeons, mourn the loss. Had the funeral been ours, the pigeons would hardly have mourned us. In this fact, rather than in Mr. DuPont's nylons or Mr. Vannevar Bush's bombs, lies objective evidence of our superiority over the beasts. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --Thus always does history, whether of marsh or market place, end in paradox. The ultimate value in these marshes is wildness, and the crane is wildness incarnate. But all conservation of wildness is self-defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wildness left to cherish. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --There's an extended part of this book where the author and others saw through an old oak that has fallen on his property. He cites the history, backwards, as they saw through, ring by ring, year by year. It's splendid stuff and not conventional history like Hitler did this or General Sherman did that; but, more about carp planting and barbed wire and the things meadow mice have been know to do. At the end (beginning) of each decade, we hear: Rest! cries the chief sawyer, and we pause for breath. So, there's a musical cadence too. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --Sorry for quoting so much, but I hope you see why I did. This book is in three parts: the first two are his observations of nature and the last part is kind of a call to arms for conservation of wilderness. This book was written almost 70 years ago and Leopold knew, even then, that what he was preaching was a lost cause. Yet this book remains in 'the higher gamut.'  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Four boarding passes, and four light-rail link passes, gave their lives, in little torn pieces, to mark the many passages in this book worth remembering. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --*I read almost this exact quote two weeks ago in the book  Rendez-vous with Art.

            "\u201cConservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamic concept of land. We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity, belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.\u201dPublished in 1949, Aldo Leopold is an early conservationist, following in the footsteps of John Muir. The book is arranged seasonally in the essay format of an almanac. It is focused on the natural region of the author\u2019s home in Wisconsin. It features lovely nature writing: \u201cOn motionless wing they emerge from the lifting mists, sweep a final arc of sky, and settle in clangorous descending spirals to their feeding grounds. A new day has begun on the crane marsh.\u201dI very much enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in the history of conservation. ",
            "First published in 1949, A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There by Aldo Leopold was definitely way ahead of its time. Much of that stated within remains valid and relevant still today. It is a book about conservation and ecology and man\u2019s relationship to land. At the author\u2019s death, in April 1948, the book existed in draft form. His son edited it and brought it into publication a year later.The book has four parts. The first section reads as a monthly nature almanac. Here is recorded observations of flora and fauna on the author\u2019s 120-acre property in Sauk County, Wisconsin. Thereafter follows snippets, stories, assorted writings at other locations in Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa, Arizona and New Mexico, Chihuahua and Sonora in northwestern Mexico, Oregon and Utah and finally Manitoba, Canada. The third and then the final fourth section, more and more philosophical, academic and didactic in tone, have essays on conservation, ecology and what the author calls \u201cland ethics\u201d, which, simply put, is the relationship that should exist between the land and those inhabiting it. As with all collections of essays, some essays are better than others. One\u2019s appreciation of the first and second sections will depend upon the reader\u2019s recognition of the flora and fauna spoken of. Knowing intimately the landscapes will add to one\u2019s appreciation too. My interest was aroused when the creatures and plants I meet on daily walks in France and Sweden are mentioned. The same will be valid for others too. The prose style is not lyrical. It is philosophical. The author voices his views. His self-assurance is manifest. He has a tendency to look down upon others. The last section is excessively academic and theoretical in tone. He categorically states that the final section will not be of interest to the layman. I found the essays in the second and third sections best and the theorizing in the final section overblown. Many lines are wise and true. Note the irony embedded in some. Consider the following quotes:\u201cTo those devoid of imagination, a blank place on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part.\ufffd\ufffd\u201cAll conservation of wildness is self-defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish.\u201d\u201cEducation is learning to see one thing by going blind to another.\u201dSpeaking of a frightening but magnificent thunderstorm, Leopold says, \u201cIt must be a poor life that achieves freedom from fear.\u201dSpeaking of two boys on a camping trip, he says, \u201cThe wilderness gave them complete freedom to make mistakes.\u201dNote the humor here, \u201cPines, like people, are choosy about their associates.\u201dAnd this, in speaking of how other writers and observers of nature fail to register the effects of wind on the bodies of fowl -- \u201cThey (other authors' books) are written behind stoves.\u201d\u201cWe grieve only for what we know.\u201dThis is so very true!Other times, that which Leopold says is questionable. How he looks at hunters and hunting is one example\u2014he is a man of his time. It is stated that Europeans do not camp or partake of meals outside! That is just not true, and it had me questioning the validity of other statements made! This is, I suppose, merely a petitesse. Much of that which is stated about the value of conservation is today accepted by all. The author speaks of the need to make people aware of the immense satisfaction husbandry of land can bring to a soul. He seeks to encourage the general public\u2019s awareness and perception of nature\u2019s magnificence and innate beauty. He warns us that we must care for it, preserve it for future generations. All of this I support, but tell me, who wouldn\u2019t?! The book\u2019s content is amazing, particularly if one considers how long ago it was written. And yet I must also say that the writing lacks the lyrical resonance of Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. It does not pull you in as Carson\u2019s does, not by a long shot.Mike Chamberlain narrates the audiobook. He speaks clearly. The tempo is not rushed, but the reading is without modulation. He drones on and on. The audio performance I have given three stars.*********************Silent Spring 5 stars by Rachel Carson*A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There 3 stars by Aldo Leopold",
            "This latest and best issue of the classic A Sand County Almanac captures Leopold's philosophy with magnificent photographs by Michael Sewell.This edition, in conjunction with the Aldo Leopold Foundation (which fosters an ethical relationship between people and land), includes some facsimiles of the original almanac and, more importantly, a number of short essays on The Land Ethic.",
            "As a conservationist, Leopold was an heir to Thoreau and a thinker ahead of his time, yet I expect few people know how much of our current philosophy of wildness and the human impact on the world is indebted to him. This was first published in 1949, the year after Leopold\u2019s death, but so many of his musings ring true today: how we only appreciate wildlife if we can put an economic value on it, the troubles we get into when we eradicate predators and let prey animals run rampant, and the danger of being disconnected from the land that supplies our very life. And all of this he delivers in beautiful, incisive prose. The almanac itself, a month-by-month account of life in his native patch of Wisconsin, contributes less than half of the length of the book; the rest is composed of occasional pieces set everywhere from Mexico to Manitoba. Although I liked the almanac best, there are memorable lines strewn throughout. (Charles W. Schwartz\u2019s black-and-white illustrations are also wonderful.)\u201cWe abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.\u201d\u201cThere are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.\u201d\u201cA conservationist is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke he is writing his signature on the face of his land.\u201d\u201cwhereas I write a poem by dint of mighty cerebration, the yellow-leg walks a better one just by lifting his foot.\u201d",
            "This book is a true classic and canonized piece of Nature Literature. Leopold was an ecology scientist at the U of Wisconsin, Madison, who bought a small piece of property in the Sand County region in central Wisconsin, where he and his family would take long weekends and vacations, fixing the place up and enjoying nature.The essays collected in this amazing book are Leopold's musings and observations on his little chunk of the wilderness, reflecting on everything from sipping coffee outside in the morning as he listens to the litany of chickadees and nuthatches surrounding him in the post-sunrise woods, to the balance of an ecosystem captured in the description of a childhood experience of shooting a wolf. The prose is rich and deep, and draws the reader along into looking at the world through a fresh lens -- a lens that accentuates the ordinary and helps us gain a more proper perspective on life.I love this book. I've read it many times, and have pushed it onto many a hapless reader . . . including my kids. If you have even a tiny bit of appreciation for nature and the outdoors, you will love this book. That is not something I say about very many of the Nature Lit type books, but this is one. I've taught it many times as part of the reading list in my college Nature Lit course, and have had numerous students tell me they were stunned at how good this book is, and how it changed the way they look at the world around them.Get it. Read it. It's that simple.... :-) ",
            "Completed shortly before his death in 1948, University of Wisconsin forestry professor  Aldo Leopold grants his readers the supreme privilege of seeing nature through the original ecologist's eyes. Leopold was probably not the first to use the term ecologist",
            "Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac is a compelling blend of beautiful depictions of nature, personal opinion and reflection, and political commentary. Leopold extols the beauty of nature and emphasizes how much humans are a part of it. As members of the natural world, humans have a dramatic effect on the environment, and Leopold does not shy away from this issue. Rather than advocate for total preservation of wilderness, Leopold expresses the value of hunting and using the resources present in the wild. Hunting, he argues, is actually a way to become more attuned to the subtleties of a natural environment. Leopold's commentary about how nature should be used is one of the most striking things about the book, second only to the reverent appreciation of nature that he expresses. \tLeopold depicts hunting as a meditative process in which the hunter becomes part of his environment and develops an understanding of and respect for his prey. This seems reasonable, despite my personal instinct that an environmentalist must be against hunting. Of course, Leopold cannot condone all methods of hunting. The new age of \u201cgadgeteers\u201d (214) and the hunters who buy their wares are not in tune with nature. Leopold wonders if they are \u201cabsorbing cultural value\u201d or \u201cjust feeding minks\u201d with the birds missed by their hasty shots (215). It is interesting to hear someone with such respect for nature also acknowledge that he enjoys killing animals. I didn't particularly respect this position; I am glad to hear that he does not use too many high tech gadgets, and I know that hunting is something of a national pastime, but I can't wrap my mind around it as acceptable unless it is done for subsistence. This is not to say that I haven't enjoyed wild turkey meatballs and venison sausage killed by the local hunters in my town, but hunting seems so barbaric. Yet we are animals with all the instincts that entails, and meat sure does taste good. Somehow I can only approve of hunting when it is done only with tools found in nature and made by hand. Paleolithic hunting methods are pretty much the only ones I can condone, but maybe I need to get over my romanticized ideas about nature. I have always thought that if everything we build our bodies with comes from nature, and we eat animals that have suffered and been tortured, and then we turn their cells into our cells, we are building ourselves out of sorrow. ",
            "This book provided great inspiration and insight for my current novel-in-progress, which has an environmental element.It was actually published shortly after the author died of a heart attack, in 1949. Leopold's life was cut far too short, and I can't help but wonder how much further America's conservation efforts might have evolved in the past 50 years had he lived longer. Many of his observations and warnings from the early part of the 1900s still ring true today. In that respect, this book was somewhat of a bittersweet read for me. I read his biography, A Fierce Green Fire, a couple of years ago, and this was a nice complement to that. In this collection of essays about the land he loved, Leopold shared his views as a conservationist, scientist and observer of life in lovely, often literary, prose that surprised me and hit an emotional chord. His essay, Thinking Like a Mountain, brought a lump to my throat and an ache in my heart as he described how he once participated in the killing of wolves in his conservation work for the federal government",
            "Wow. Even though my parents owned few books and yet did own this, I never got around to it. And maybe as a child I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much. But now, goodness, I recognize that it belongs on the same shelf as Thoreau, Rachel Carson, Bernd Heinrich, and Michael Perry. The man is indeed a hero for the conservation movement, and writes beautifully. Wisconsin's wilderness, and the nation's perception of the value wilderness and of diverse ecosystems, owes much to him. We have made progress since his day. Yes, much has been lost with our increasing material wealth and population growth, but much has been gained in our attempts to live more in harmony with nature and to let some of it remain free.Like many another treaty of restraint",
            "it is a shame that some of the most important and beloved books become also the most neglected. taken for granted, these works are thus robbed of both majesty and worth (to say nothing of efficacy). it's as if certain books are deemed classic and then left to impart their wisdoms from atop a dusty shelf. a sand county almanac is roundly acknowledged as one of the most seminal titles in the nature/conservation/environmental writing genre, and like all great books it remains imperatively relative despite the passing years. leopold's writing is consistently vivid and animated, but it is in the final four essays that it nears brilliance in clarity and reasoning. in a time of gross disharmony over environmental policy, one would be well served in (re)reading this book to consider a well-delineated perspective articulated soundly.written in the late 1940's:...but wherever the truth may lie, this much is crystal-clear: our bigger-and-better society is now like a hypochondriac, so obsessed with its own economic health as to have lost the capacity to remain healthy. the whole world is so greedy for more bathtubs that it has lost the stability necessary to build them, or even to turn off the tap. nothing could be more salutary at this stage than a little healthy contempt for a plethora of material blessings.~a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. it tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are (as far as we know) essential to its healthy functioning. it assumes, falsely, i think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.~ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down, in the last analysis, to a question of intellectual humility. the shallow-minded modern who has lost his rootage in the land assumes that he has already discovered what is important; it is such who prate of empires, political or economic, that will last a thousand years.",
            "Are you one of those people who actually likes to read Thoreau? Well then you\u2019re missing out! Aldo Leopold is sooooo much better. Leopold\u2019s writing is poetic yet it also calls the common person to action. Likewise Leopold walks the walk when it comes to protecting the environment. While this book didn\u2019t pass the random page test, if you like authors like Thoreau, then you should definitely check out The Sand County Almanac, which is the bible to environmentalists.

If you are a die-hard environmentalist (or you just like to read poetic things) this book is for you. ",
            "This is a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, there is incredible value to be gained from the author's keen sense of observation. The first set of essays, the Sand County Almanac, takes us through a year of observing nature at work on Leopold's farm. He discovers firsthand how certain plants fare better when collocated. He bands chickadees and later discovers the bands in the pellets of a screech owl. He gains broad insights from small things that most of us pass by every day without considering. It's an ode to getting out of the classroom and into the field. He also supplies us with several formidable quotes and anecdotes on the importance of wilderness and conservation, especially in the later essays. The Flambeau River story (pp. 112-113) and his musings on the hidden uses of adversity (p. 84) are two that especially come to mind.But Mr. Leopold is also a product of his time, and it shows. He decries the decline of the grizzly (whose numbers have since recovered) but shares a tasty outdoor recipe that uses bear fat. He decries the overhunting of various species, but then goes fishing for rainbow trout and comments with some satisfaction of smoking on a midstream rock while he could hear the trout kicking in the bed of wet alder leaves at the bottom of the creel (p. 38). Cruel. In some respects",
            "In honor of re-reading this book I take an hour walk in my neighborhood before I write my review. Behind the loud barking of too many dogs and below the many paved roads and above the blooming non-native eucalyptus and acacia I hear the trilling of the junco and call of red shouldered hawk. I see light sparkling on a natural stream that flows open to the air. I smell the Douglas fir, and I feel the sun pouring out her loving warmth and light. I envision bat houses and blooming native plants at the too perfect grounds of the Mormon temple, and I make a ritual out of speaking to the man who is digging up long untouched soil to redo a fence. I mourn at the spot where wild honeybees have been evicted from the hollow of a eucalyptus tree and I admire the honeycombs the bees had built.Let Aldo Leopold speak to you, and who knows what you might notice in your neighborhood. I'm planning to attend a gathering near Point Reyes in one month, Geography of Hope, and this year's inspiration behind the gathering is Aldo Leopold's land ethic. We will see a film called Green Fire",
            "First published in 1949, this is a 3-part series of essays by prominent wilderness-advocate Aldo Leopold. Part 1, A Sand County Almanac, is Leopold's month-by-month observations on his Wisconsin farm. Parts 2 and 3, Sketches Here and There and The Upshot, are essays he wrote about his ideas on land use and wildlife conservation. Personally, I thought Part 1 was the best. The monthly info was kind of nice, although not nearly as charming as Hal Borland's lesser-known Beyond Your Doorstep: A Handbook to the Country (published in 1962). Borland's observations were more complete and wide-ranging (and is much more than a monthly accounting) and gave a better feeling for what his farm was like than Leopold's. But this book became a chore to read in Parts 2 and 3 when he gives his prescriptions for the issues of the day. Part 2 especially reminded me of a saying I once heard that an environmentalist is someone who already has his cabin in the woods (or farm in the country, in this case) and complains about the more recent arrivals than himself. And Part 3 just sounded seriously outdated - which makes sense since it was written 70 years ago. I don't recommend this book simply because there are much better options. If you're interested in outdoor writing because you want a little escape, I highly recommend the above mentioned Borland book, or perhaps A Naturalist Goes Fishing if you're into that. If you're looking for a travelogue-of-sorts of some of our environmental messes/challenges, I recommend John McPhee's The Control of Nature. If you're looking for more serious histories about environmental problems I'll offer several suggestions: Nature Wars, Engineering Eden, Four Fish, or Megafire. If you don't mind a little controversy, I'd also recommend The New Wild as a very thought-provoking read. After all, there's only so much time to read - make it count.",
            "Aldo Leopold\u2019s A Sand County Almanac is one of the foundational texts of the conservation and environmental movements, a text that now over 70 years past its publication date is still repeatedly commented upon and cited by activists arguing for the preservation and guardianship of the natural world. It has inspired any number of important nature writers, not only because of Leopold\u2019s astoundingly detailed and passionate descriptions of the natural world and its intricacies, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, because of the ethical imperative he argues must define and guide our relationship with land\u2014and by land he means not only the land itself but also all the flora and fauna that live there. More on this in a moment. The text is divided into three parts: an almanac of Leopold\u2019s observations of the natural world during a year at his farm in Wisconsin; an assortment of occasional essays mostly on his excursions to other parts of the US and Canada; and four essays, in a section appropriately entitled \u201cThe Upshot,\u201d that provide the philosophical grounding of his environmental ethics. As a biologist and a professor of wildlife management (the first one at the University of Wisconsin), Leopold brings the eye of the trained scientist to the sensitivity of a far-thinking humanist, an integrated vision that may not seem all that striking now (given the wealth of nature writing in the past several decades, in part spurred by the climate crisis) but was quite revolutionary back in Leopold\u2019s day.Whatever his startling presentations of the natural world, it\u2019s Leopold\u2019s conception of what he called \u201ca land ethic\u201d that has had such a crucial impact on generations of conservationists and environmentalists. Leopold argued that for most people land was merely property, the only relation economic. In challenging this perspective, Leopold called for extending the boundaries of ethics beyond the human community to the community of the natural world\u2014\u201csoils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.\u201d \u201cIn short, Leopold writes, \u201ca land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.\u201d At the center of his ethical system was this touchstone: \u201cA thing is right when it ends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it ends otherwise.\u201d In the coming dire years wrought by the climate crisis, let\u2019s hope more people (and corporations, if that\u2019s possible) come round to Leopold\u2019s thinking.",
            "There are three parts to this book. The first, 'A Sand County Almanac', is the prettiest part. Mostly essays about Leopold's love and connection with nature throughout his life. The second part, 'Sketches Here and There', is exactly that, essays about the places he has spent time in and his reflections on how we use and abuse these places. The last part, 'The Upshot', is the hardest writing. Here Leopoldo puts his background in forestry and wildlife management to use describing what's happening to our environment and what the future holds in store if it continues in this fashion.It's amazing when you look at the fact this was written sometime in the 40's how relevant Leopold's concerns and warnings still are. Some of the things he saw happening have become much worse and some are still an ongoing process. Have we really made so little progress in the last 60 years? Apparently...",
            "Aldo Leopold\u2019s book, A Sand County Almanac, is near the top of many lists of environmental classics. It was published in 1949, and has sold over two million copies. He was born in Iowa in 1887, when Earth was inhabited by just 1.4 billion humans. It was an era before radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, computers, DDT, nuclear fission, and antibiotics. Most roads were dirt. Vast ancient forests still thrived. On the first page, Leopold informs us that this is a book for people who cannot live without wild things.Part one is a series of twelve sketches, one for each month. They describe how the land changes during the circle of the seasons \u2014 the return of the geese, the mating ritual of the woodcocks, the rutting of the deer, the bloody snow where predators snatched prey. They describe what life was like in simpler times, before the sprawl, the malls, the highways, the tsunami of idiotic consumer crap. People were more in touch with the life of the land, because it had not yet been deleted.In 1935, Leopold bought a farm in Wisconsin. The previous owner had tried and failed to make a living tilling the lean sandy soil. The place was cheap, far from the highway, worthless to civilization, but a precious sanctuary for a nature-loving professor. Luckily, the soil mining enterprise perished quickly, before it had time to exterminate the wildness.Leopold loved the great outdoors. He loved hiking and hunting. Birds fascinated him. He spent many years working for the U.S. Forest Service, and later became a professor of Game Management at the University of Wisconsin. Sadly, he lived in a culture that was waging full-scale war on nature, and this drove him mad. It was so senseless. During his life, the population had grown from 1.5 to 2.4 billion, an era of staggering out of control disruption.Part two presents observations, made in assorted times and places, about the damaged relationship between Americans and nature. This relationship was often abusive, because it lacked love. There often was no relationship at all. Many folks had no sense of connection to the rest of the family of life. For them, nature was nothing more than a treasure chest of resources that God created for the amusement of ambitious nutjobs.Leopold was saddened by the trends. He learned to never revisit places that had amazed him in his youth. It was too painful to see the damage that commerce and tourism were tirelessly inflicting. It was best not to turn sweet memories into heartbreaking nightmares.He was raised in an era when it was perfectly normal to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators at every opportunity. These \u201cvermin\u201d killed too many game animals, depriving hunters of their rightful harvest. The most famous essay in this book is Thinking Like a Mountain. Having just shot a wolf, the gunman noticed a fierce green glow in its eyes. With the wolves eliminated, the deer multiplied in numbers, stripping the vegetation off the mountain, and wrecking the ecosystem. Deer lived in fear of wolves, and the mountain lived in fear of deer.Part three is essays describing the need for a land ethic. Cultures have ethics to define right and wrong. Traditionally, these defined person-to-person interactions, or the interactions between individuals and society. Leopold lamented that American culture lacked a land ethic, rules for living with the natural world, the family of life. In our culture, as long as the land was not claimed and defended by someone else, you were free to do whatever you pleased.Mainstream education was close to useless, because it was incapable of recognizing the glaring defects in the mainstream worldview. It loaded young minds with the crash-prone software of infantile self-interest. Generation after generation was being programmed to spend their lives as robotic servants to our economic system. The education system and the economic system were the two primary threats to the health of the land. Today, 65 years later, the lunacy has become a roaring hurricane. Leopold would be horrified and furious.Leopold was a pleasant lad, glowing with love for the natural world, and a gifted storyteller. But this should not be the only ecology book you ever read. Since 1949, there has been an explosion of research in anthropology, archaeology, ecology, and environmental history. Many important discoveries have been made about hunter-gatherers, agriculture, deforestation, civilization, finite resources, climate change, and ecological sustainability. Today\u2019s deep ecologists will sneer at a few statements in the book, but in 1949, no one was more radical than Leopold.At the time, he knew we were on a bad path, and we needed to pay serious attention to where it was taking us. He clearly understood what we needed. He wrote, \u201cConservation is a state of harmony between men and land.\u201d He was sketching out a concept now known as ecological sustainability. Here\u2019s his land ethic in a nutshell: \u201cA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\u201d Great!Since the book was published, population has skyrocketed from 2.4 to 7.3 billion. Our leaders, educators, and the vast human herd remain lost in a dream world where perpetual growth is the only channel on the glowing screens. It has paralyzed our culture, and condemned our descendants. It\u2019s running out of time. Hopefully, in its aftermath, important lessons will be learned and never forgotten.Leopold\u2019s book was written \u201cfor people who cannot live without wild things.\u201d As the swelling mobs surge into vast cities, our disconnection from wild nature is almost complete. We have forgotten who we are, and where we came from. Well, we\u2019re wild animals, and we came from wild nature, like every other critter. Darwin revealed this embarrassing secret, but it still makes us uncomfortable, since it clashes with our deepest, darkest myths, our grandiose illusions of superiority.These anthropocentric myths have ancient roots in every civilized culture, and they are like venomous brain worms that turn us into planet thrashing monsters. In 1949, few expressed doubts about these myths, but Leopold did. He was a flaming radical in his day. He often dreamed that the progressive movement would eventually grow, flourish, and address the primary challenges of our time, but reality hasn\u2019t cooperated.His vision of a land ethic would have been a first step, but not a miraculous cure. No other animal needs a formal system of rules and regulations to discourage self-destructive behavior. Like our chimp and bonobo cousins, the others have never forgotten who they are, or how to live. Thinking like an animal has worked perfectly for millions of years. Thinking like a conqueror has been a disastrous failure.",

            "Passionate, thoughtful and with an eye for subtle beauty, Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac (much like Rachel Carson's Silent Spring) is a Bible for the modern environmental movement. His writing combines the acute perceptivity of the scientist with the holistic understanding of the conservationist. He preached the gospel of conservation before it was popular to do so; at a time when the memories of buffalo and passenger pigeons still swarmed like fruit flies over the collective guilty conscience of a people who were just waking up to the consequences of their impact on the world around them. He understood the connection between the health of the environment and the prosperity of mankind at a time when the science of ecology was still in it's infancy. As population and environmental pressures make themselves more painfully felt, I believe Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic will prove more pertinent than ever before, not just to the health of the environment, but to the future of humanity.",
            "Powerful, inspiring, and passion driven is just a few words I would use to describe this book. Anyone who doubts the importance of conservations needs to read this book. I loved the book but it takes it made me cry, made me rage and made me question a lot of things. His words were powerful and really made me think about what I believe and how I impacted the world I lived in. You could feel so much in his words and on passage in particular will stay with me forever.  We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then"

        "description": "Here's another Star Wars spinoff novel, a brisk and extremely uncomplicated action-adventure romp set on planet Coruscant immediately before the events of The Phantom Menace. After a few setting-up exercises, it's essentially a prolonged chase sequence whose implacable pursuer is Darth Maul--the almost absurdly villainous-looking Sith Lord with the biggest lightsaber and worst makeup job in the entire saga to date. The plot? Insidiously evil Darth Sidious is poised to launch the Naboo trade blockade featured in The Phantom Menace. But one of his alien henchmen has sneaked away to betray this scheme and must die. So must the traitor's contacts, smalltime crook Lorn Pavan and his uppity droid, I-Five. Likewise Darsha Assant, the female Jedi Knight apprentice who gets entangled with Pavan through either mind-boggling coincidence or the mysterious ways of the Force. Michael Reaves makes a reasonably slick job of all this nonsense and is not afraid of clich\u00e9s. Plenty of characters have wooden lines like \"I've got a bad feeling about this,\" and \"Too many questions, and not enough answers.\" Meanwhile in the Jedi council, Yoda makes characteristic remarks: \"A good choice he would be... No accident this was.\" Unfortunately, the well-known story line of The Phantom Menace defuses suspense in Shadow Hunter. That trade blockade has to happen despite the good folks' doomed heroics, and horrible Darth Maul (already far more powerful and deadly than the puny opposition he faces here) is fated to win out. This novel is for dedicated fans only. --David Langford",

            "Good story, well done. Having fewer ensemble cast members of the Star Wars pantheon gives the author more outcome flexibility, but knowing where the story has to end up still gives the reader too much knowledge of what has to happen to the non-canon players. (Is that a spoiler?)The more I'm exposed to the SW universe, the more the technology baffles me. First, over the span of about five thousand years a galaxie--stuffed with advanced cultures--seems to make no technology improvements--despite wars, famine and floods (well, maybe no floods). Travel, weapons, communications, etc. all seem frozen at one level. Look at what's happened here in the last five hundred years.Second, more like a quibble, the lack of communication between Jedi less than twenty kilometers from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is a major element of this story, and it makes no sense. First, they should all have comm implants. So their comm links don't get lost, stolen, or broken. Then, they ought to track each other through the Force, if nothing else. I would think Darsha's mentor would be monitoring her through the Force every minute she's on her final exam assignment. Considering what she went through and how she reacted to it",

His hopes and dreams are rudimentary and his goal is to kill and destroy wherever his master (Darth Sidious a.k.a. the future Emperor Palaptine) sends him.Speaking of Sidious",

They are all now on Darth Maul\u2019s death list, fighting for their lives, escaping over and over with a lot of good fortune.This is a light weight novel: Easy and quick to read but not completely satisfying. When dealing with a character like Darth Maul I wanted the tone to be darker, but it was too tame. I didn\u2019t feel the evil that Maul supposedly possesses. As the odd circumstances that let his quarry escape pile up you get the feeling the author didn\u2019t really know what to do with this set up to make it compelling. Also, for a novel that has Darth Maul\u2019s name in the title, there wasn\u2019t enough of the character in the story. I felt like I read more about the other characters than the lead."

Thus, the two become public enemies!For starters, the first half was pretty solid, however, the second half, I just did not care for.The story is fine, it's just that it would have been better if Jeph Loeb had not wrote it.More often than not, his dialogue comes off as stiffy to me, the kind of dialogue that you would find in comics from between the '60s/70s. There's nothing wrong with that per se, I'm not the right target for that, unfortunately.It saddens me, that aside from a few stuff that he did most of his work does not appeal to me.4/10",

I'm not sure about the artwork some of it works and then at times it looks like a shitty knock off Bruce Timm. After reading some reviews i was expecting some over the top bromance, proclamations of love, life saving endearing moments, y'know a lil something something.  But nah son, you all lied. It's probably a bit too cutesy for me, i need more drama from my guys and at least 70% more brooding from Batsy. Also there's a line about Alfred in this that really annoyed me and i don't get it, i don't think Bruce would only think of Alfred as just the 'help' like come on without Alfred, Bruce would be 100% done. Annnnnd i've read a bunch of Loeb's work and this is the only one where it didn't feel like his writing like i had to double check he wrote this, usually my emotions have been kicked in the teeth or there's a plot twist this doesn't have either, and i know he isnt glued to Sale's side but i missed his art. It's definitely one for Lex fans he kinda steals this show in this and Batman and Superman are kinda meh. I'd still say pick it up just don't expect a lot and if you do want a good Batman and Superman bromance then pick up Snyder's unchained instead. ",
            "An okay read! So this my first time reading the comic for this story, their was an animated film of this story, that I have watched over ten times! Unfortunately overall, I think I like the animated film better... My major issue with this story is just how confusing a lot of it is, I don't wanna spoil, but so much stuff happens in this one book that its crazy; I can see why the animated film they had to simplify the story a lot, but this one time, it was for the right reasons! So basically the story is that a giant Kryptonite meteor is headed for earth, this is during that period in the comics when Luthor was President, and Luthor blames Superman for the meteor(In the most stupidest way possible, more on that later). Usually I like Luthor, he is by far my favourite Superman Villain, but this and Batman v Superman, are the two times where I didn't like him; they do explain later why he is acting so weird, but for me it was too late. Also my other gripe is the reason Luthor gives for blaming Superman, for the meteor, its like really stupid(That's something I'm glad they changed in the movie), and the fact that most of the heroes eat it up, and just believe whatever Lex says, really stupid. Positive's I love how the book constantly contrasts Batman and Superman, from the awesome opening to end, its written and done really well! But overall guys, I'm disappointed, I wanted to love this story, but overall, I'd rather watch the movie then read this again! ",
            "You can find my review on our blog by clicking here.The world\u2019s oldest question: Superman or Batman? Now, what if it isn\u2019t always a \u201cor\u201d? The two titans haven\u2019t always been either side of the fence. Although their sense of justice and their means vary grandly thanks to differences in their childhoods, there are various similarities that bring these two together more often than not. Legendary Jeph Loeb brings forth one of the many popular series that stars the \u201cWorld\u2019s Finest\u201d duo as they tackle the danger that lies within their reach. With Gods roaming Gotham and Metropolis, it is only fair to find non-believers among the crowd. Superman/Batman (Volume 1): Public Enemies reunites the two biggest members of the Justice League in a story of survival. President Lex Luthor announces that an imminent meteorite made out of nothing other than the famous and scrumptious Kryptonite is heading straight towards Earth. Jumping on the opportunity, Luthor convinces the world that Superman is at fault and conveys a \u201cWanted Dead or Live\u201d order on Superman, with an extra 1 billion dollars on his forehead. With a special secret team in the palm of his hands, known villains appear from the shadows to take up for grabs the great Superman and his partner, Batman.Dark, gritty, cynic, and filled with death, it wasn\u2019t. Simply put, this first volume to the series was simple, action-packed and passionate on several level. The first issues gets both titans to meet again over mysterious circumstances and lead them into a confrontation with a villain who might hold pertinent information for Batman\u2019s past. Until we get a blast from the past with the arrival of Future Superman, things start to become urgent and chaotic. The alert of an imminent treat as well as disclosure on a potential mistake lead Superman and Batman to quickly hatch up a plan to seize the danger. Until the President comes forth to the media and puts the whole weight of the danger on Superman\u2019s back. Accused for the giant chunk of Kryptonite coursing its way through the galaxy to Earth, Superman and Batman team up to take down Lex Luthor and find a solution to the problem in the sky. It is only from this part on that we\u2019re gifted with a dose of DC Universe and its almighty collection of superheroes and villains. Page after page, we\u2019re treated with a nifty collection of fights between Superman and Batman against the world.I\u2019m quite thankful that this turned out a lot better than The Dark Knight Strikes Again, because that sequel was one atrocious pile of poo. With Ed McGuinness\u2019 artwork, this first volume captures a more bubbly and cartoonish illustration. Although it does exhibit a finely drawn artwork, it felt a lot closer to an animated TV show put on paper. It isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it does take away any attempt to make it anything close to sinister. The artwork does however put forth a more colorful palette and gives all the characters a more vibrant and popping presence. After all, with the countless number of appearances, especially the inclusion of both Superman and Batman\u2019s \u201cfamilies\u201d, the artwork was a great complement. While we\u2019re still on this subject, I\u2019d even say that the whole experience was so overwhelming, but still remained satisfying. Seeing the beloved heroes of DC unite in one volume and figure out their different allegiances was probably the highlight of this volume.Hey man, how is it \u201cpassionate on several level\u201d? Well, friend, listen here. Although it might have been unintentional, Jeph Loeb\u2019s writing for this volume depicted more bromance than necessary. Aside from the sexual jokes toward a certain character (Yes. You. Power Girl.), Superman and Batman\u2019s relationship is probably the most exuberant part. To highlight this, I\u2019ll definitely point at the narration. Original and clever overall, it however also added an extra layer of acute admiration for each other (Superman and Batman). Throughout the volume, both Batman and Superman narrate the story with background descriptions on themselves and comparisons to their fellow partner. As they continuously alternate bubbles, each pair are fairly similar and showcases the similarities between the two heroes, despite their differences. But these very similarities also show admiration and a level of bromance that slightly spills over the threshold. Even if the narration is overlooked, some scenes between these two Gods illustrates the love nonetheless. However, I did enjoy how laid-back Batman seemed, and giggle a little bit at his inability to panic and rush. While on the other hand, Superman\u2019s recklessness and simpleton manner held some comedic value.Superman/Batman (Volume 1): Public Enemies is still a fun and adrenaline pumped volume. It\u2019s never a bad thing to have the two blockbuster superheroes share the same panel and wreck havoc against shared enemies. Another part I actually enjoyed are the allusions done to chess. The idea behind the metaphors was fun and invigorating. It showed tactic, strategy and chemistry. I do have to say that I\u2019m a sucker for anything related to chess. I see a lot of things like a game of chess. And now I see Batman in the mist of it? Win. Even if the volume as a whole was quite hectic and simple plot-wise, it remained a fun and creative path taken by Jeph Loeb. If you ask me, Jeph Loeb knows his chess pieces and doesn\u2019t hesitate in making good use of them. Although there are plenty of other series that are far superior to this Superman/Batman series, this still remains one of the many long series that has attracted attention and brings two of our favorite heroes together.Yours truly,LashaanLashaan & Trang | Bloggers and Book ReviewersOfficial blog: http://bookidote.wordpress.com_____________________________I thought it would be a good idea to check out one of the many series where Superman and Batman are under the same spotlight before Batman v Superman comes out. It's one thing to see them team up instead of fighting each other, but to see them go beyond bromance? Wish it didn't go overboard. The artwork felt so bubbly; like it was made to have a animated adaptation in the future (which it does!). The story is fairly simple, but the first volume contains a HUGE chunk of DCU. I wonder if it has as many as The Dark Knight Strikes Again... One thing's for sure, this was by far better than Frank Millers attempt to put every hero in one book.The story is fun nonetheless...if you can overlook all the flaws that jump in your face! ;)P.S. A full review will before BvS comes out in theaters!Yours truly,LashaanLashaan & Trang | Bloggers and Book ReviewersOfficial blog: http://bookidote.wordpress.com",
            "Kali pertama seumur hidup aku membaca komik adiwira barat. Di hari krismas pulak tu. Aku tak adalah apa2 jangkaan tinggi pasal komik ni sebab minda aku dah lama dipengaruhi oleh manga jepun dan komik tempatan. Jadi aku rasa komik ni biasa2 sahaja jalan ceritanya. Kau sudah boleh agak agak apa yang akan terjadi, pelbagai adiwira dan adijahat yang muncul dalam komik ni dan aku gembira sebab aku kenal hampir kesemuanya (sebab dah layan hampir kesemua filem adiwira DC kot). Rasanya rakyat malaysia lebih cenderung menonton filem dari membaca komik adiwira, sebab tu penerbitannya cuma sempat 3 buah je. Apa yang aku kurang suka ialah terlalu banyak cakap/dialog melankolik, aksi pun 1-2 panel sahaja apabila bertemu adijahat, maklumlah banyak karakter yang muncul, kalau lawan sampai 10 mukasurat mahu tebal gila buku ni. Lagi satu faktor kekuatan Superman yang kita sedia tahu bahawa dia ni kuat gila nak mampus dan kelemahannya hanyalah Kryptonite, terlalu baik dan Lois Lane. Tak logik pun ada bila Batman bertarung, kita tahu yang Batman ni manusia biasa tapi selamba je menang dengan adijahat dan adiwira yang bukan manusia. Ikut logik akal, Batman hanyalah tikus bersayap (ayat salah satu adijahat dalam ni yang memang kelakar!)p/s: Batman hanyalah tikus bersayap.",
            "Honestly, this is my second favorite Batman/Superman story. It does such a great job showing why Bruce and Clark share a bond to begin with. Loeb did a great job with Bruce and Clark's narratives being parallels of each other. You see them reading each other's minds throughout the entire case, being on the same page, thinking almost exclusively about each other throughout the entire arc. Bruce is constantly worried about Clark's safety and going so far as to say he'd be okay with whatever punishment Clark doled out to Luthor because of what Luthor had done to Clark. Clark worries about Bruce constantly and expresses a secret wish that Bruce would stop being Batman, despite all the good he's done, because Clark worries that it will one day get Bruce killed. They understand each other so completely and have such a storied past. It's wonderful to see and I really enjoy reading a story where their bond leads to them saving the day - not just fighting each other. The only detriment for me was that I forgot how poorly the women were used - in the three or so pages they were present. Didn't appreciate Power Girl being told her usefulness in this plot was to distract a 13 year old with her boobs (hey, thanks) or the random kiss between Luthor and Waller that resulted in an incredibly OOC response from her. Again, in some cases, better to not feature women at all if this is how they're going to be used. ",
            "Jeph Loeb...just this name is enough to motivate me into reading this series, and Mr. Loeb really doesn't disappoint. Plus the artwork is also good.PS: and President Lex Luther isn't such a bad idea after we saw what is going on in the real-life USA!"

            "Faeries is a wonderful book: illustrations that are charming, eerie and beautiful, and stories and a wealth of information on fairy-lore. I learned some things that surprised me - for example, although I was aware that people used to attribute prehistoric flint arrowheads to the fairies, I didn't know that the word 'stroke' for paralysis derives from a belief in seizures caused by the touch of a fairy, or 'Elf-stroke'. And although I've read the Harry Potter series a number of times, and tend to notice which elements of myth and fairytale Rowling draws on, it wasn't until reading Froud and Lee's description of Brownies being insulted by the gift of clothes, that I made the connection between Brownies and House Elves (furthermore I was a Brownie Guide when I was about seven!).Faeries reminds me how people from not so long ago viewed the world very differently to how we do now. Our ancestors dwelt in a world that was mysterious and unpredictable, shaped by capricious beings whom they sought to propitiate and protect themselves from. My favourite pictures and tales in Faeries are those which emphasis the thin membrane between the human world and the enchanted one, such as fairy islands or or cities under the the surface of a lake.And those that remind me of the uncanny sense of magic I sometimes gain from the world I live in: in my walks along the River Kelvin near my home in Glasgow I can just imagine coming across a Ghillie Dhu in the birch trees, or a lonely, Gollum-esque Urisk",
            "This is the book that made Brian Froud famous and has yet to be surpassed. Alan Lee's ethereal watercolors are just as breathtaking and provide a lovely counterpoint to Froud's more dramatic drawings. But don't let the glowing images fool you into thinking this is just another coffee table art book. The folklore contained therein is just as sound. The flora and fauna sections are especially worthwhile. There is also a dangerous aspect to this work",
            "This book is, quite frankly, a masterpiece. There's just no other way for me to refer to it. It has become one of my most treasured possessions and I know for a fact I will come back to it many times over the years.The amazingly talented Brian Froud and Alan Lee give us a much closer and realistic look into the world of Faerie than what most people are used to from pop culture. The general public who aren't familiar with Faery lore tend to think about pretty girls with wings in dresses when they think about faeries. While this is in fact true in some cases, there is a whole world out there for you to explore when it comes to faeries... And trust me, this book doesn't sugarcoat any of it.You won't only find mind-blowingly gorgeous illustrations within these pages, but also detailed information about a huge variety of faeries; from their appearance to their behaviour and/or their lifestyles, short stories, myths and legends, even flora and trees that are relevant to the world of Faerie. And more. Much, much more.This book touches upon pretty much every single topic you could ever think of when it comes to faeries, and it manages to do it (in my opinion) in a rather objective way, making it a delight to read no matter what your personal views and beliefs are.As for me, I have believed in faeries ever since I can remember, so you can imagine how much this book means to me and how grateful I am for it. I tried my hardest not to finish it too fast (in fact I'm surprised it almost lasted me two days) but alas, all good things come to an end. On the bright side, I have yet to explore all of Mr. Froud's other works!Whether you actually believe in the little folk and the many habitants of the Other Realm or you're simply a mythology and folklore nerd, your library will never be complete without this beautiful book.",
            "Whether we are aware of it or not faeries have, for as long as can be remembered, always played a part in the daily lives of men, women and especially children. For as far back as can be remembered there have been stories, ballads and legends of faeries and their ability to connect with the nature on the planet and the nature of man. Though not always with the most desired of results, for as many stories as there are of faeries bringing messages of love and friendship there are also stories of torment and death.It is perhaps the dualistic nature of these elusive beings that has drawn so many to them and their kind over the years. Within these pages the history, wisdom and playfulness of faeries can be explored, and hidden within each image beauty and inspiration are found. But whether your seeking wisdom, inspiration, or just a simplistic beauty in their existence, Fairies is a guide to the impossible made possible, the magic in wonder, and to a race of beings who, having always existed, are seen not through the eyes but through the heart and mind.Faeries, thirty years after the original, has been done up all new and golden, but there is more to this book then just a new cover. Inside this deluxe edition you will find more images, more stories and more faeries to take you deeper into the world of faery then you have ever been before. This magical book has so much to offer whether you are just curious about faeries, whether you are an avid faery lover, or whether you are seeking guidance from those elusive and captivating creatures. Not only a must for Brian Froud and Alan Lee fans but also for those with a passion for the faeries and for beautiful art.",
            "*2.5Oh dear, I honestly thought I would enjoy this one but I was so wrong.I believed this would either be a collection of already existing stories from all around the globe about creatures such as faeries, trolls etc or some kind of glossary, like the ones that exist about plants or something.And it somehow did both but so poorly.The stories about the creatures were very simplistic, with no structure at all and didn't manage to capture my attention. The authors also use other authors' writings and quotes as literal sources. Oh, did I mention that they are believers as well? Well now you know...And the glossary was very limited",

            "Wonderful artwork, I've used it as a reference book. After reading this, I've been able to recognize a lot of different mythical creatures in other works that I would not have otherwise. For instance, Jenny Green Teeth shows up in Pratchett's The Wee Free Men and the Pooka in such movies as Darby O'Gill and the Little People, and the Jimmy Stewart classic, Harvey. This is the book that influenced Jim Henson to recruit Froud's help with the movie The Dark Crystal. I didn't realize until very recently that Alan Lee worked on this book as well. Alan Lee was one of the artists that Peter Jackson recruited to design sets for The Lord of the Rings movies.",
            "Found this book again today while my mother was clearing out stuff. My dad gave it to me when I was a child, and I'm absolutely delighted to have found it again because a lot of things stayed with me. This book both enchanted and terrified me. The art is gorgeous. The lore is fairly detailed. The writing style is easier to get into now that I'm an adult. I think this is one of those books where I'd keep for life. I don't think I'd ever have any children (definitely not biologically), but if I do, I'll pass this one to them too.",
            "As a believer in the world of the Fae and Biti Foki I am so thankful for Brian and Wendy Froud. They pick up where my imagination leaves off and I have a huge imagination. They do not sugar coat the elemental realm; you get the light and dark side, as it should be. If you want to graduate from Tinkerbell to the meat and potatoes of the fae folk I suggest you become a Froud follower and fan.Denice GarrouAuthor of Dragonhorse and the Seeker of the Forgotten Knowledge",

            "No artist I know of reveals the personality of individual faeries while expressing his personal style so clearly as Brian Froud. He renders each detail with care and love; his devotion to his subjects shines through.",
            "Whilst the other book I've read like this (Goblins!) might have been rather child-orientated and lack-lustre, this one definitely isn't. It has beautiful drawings that make me want to punch everyone around me for being so good, and the information is genuine folklore fact (if such a thing exists).",
            "The first time I saw the beautiful illustrations in this book, it was like the fairy world finally came alive. Brian Froud captured both the light and darkness of the magical and mysterious fey world. ",
            "Putting this in no-fiction because it is a great source on these fantastic creatures & the artwork is wonderful. It's worth buying just to look at the pictures.",
            "This is kind of the classic book that really started the whole fantsy art genre. It has sold well and consistently every year since it's publication and there are often new anniversary editions that come out in hardback as the years go by.This wasn't the first book by Froud that I bought, but it's one of my favorites. You can really see the affection that he has for his subjects and the paintings have a certain rawness to them that later paintings do not have. I'm not saying his later work is bad mind you, just much more polished. This book gives you a bit of a look at an artists' work at the start of fully accepting his muse as it were.Very beautiful and well worth the money.",
            "This is a beautiful book! The artwork is exceptional and I could spend hours looking at the drawings. It is the definitave book on Faeries - all of the different types are named and defined as well as the different flowers and trees that are important to faerie lore.There are folk tales listed, poetry written about them, and notes from other author's stories. This is a must own volume for anyone interested in the subject.  ",
            "\tThis is a delightful book with amazing illustrations and explanations about Faeries. I enjoyed reading about all the different types of Faerie. Some I had heard of before like Brownies and Boggarts, and there were others that I had never heard of and found very interesting. It is a very readable book and some of the illustrations will take you breath away. It includes information gathered from some earlier works by other authors too.",
            "This is still my favorite of all of Brian Froud's works. The artwork is amazing but I absolutely love the literary end of this book as well. I remember reading it for the first time in high school, when I was a freshman and I was fascinated with the names and the stories and the pictures. This book is amazing. I think it would appeal to children and adults alike. ",
            "This is one of Brian Froud\u2019s older book\u2019s all done in black and white giving you that sketch pad feel. They are lovely pictures just the same. You can feel him grow as an artist if you collect his work as I have. I am a great lover of his work, he is an amazing artist. ",
            "What a world they've created, these two fantasy geniuses... I read for the art more than anything~ this is the combined effort of two of my favorite and most admired illustrators!! Each page is inspiring, and so beautiful. ",
            "Beautifully illustrated meshing together of fairy folklore through history. While the book was incredibly gorgeous, I would have been glad for more length to the descriptions and legends. I felt the book was lacking in words. I still enjoyed it and plan to check out some other books by the author. ",

            "Another fine read from Ira Levin...........After reading and loving A Kiss Before Dying, I've decided to read all of this author's novels, and my second one, The Boys From Brazil did not disappoint. Not having seen the film adaptation, the unusual plot was a complete surprise for me.The intrigue begins with a top secret meeting in a Japanese restaurant to initiate a killer of a mysterious project by 'the comrade organization'. The important operation assigns six hitmen to dispose of 94 elderly civil servants (along with their secrets) scattered throughout the world, and they must die on the designated dates set forth by the still hunted Angel of Death. (no spoiler here)The secret turns out to be a pretty darn scary scenario, one that could perhaps really happen in our day and age, but not so back in 1976 (I don't think) when TBFB was first published and Dr. Josef Mengele was still alive.Despite a couple of confusing character narration switches, another great Levin read for me that I could not put down!",

            "Despite the age of this novel (40 years), it is still a great thriller. It is a masterful mystery, where bit by bit, Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman unlocks a set of clues. He gradually pieces together the details of a terrible conspiracy to kill 94 men, all about 65 years old, around the world. The conspiracy involves Nazis from World War II, who have escaped to South America. There they are led by the incredibly evil Josef Mengele, who seeks to bring back a fourth Reich.This novel held me in its grip from the beginning to the very end. Something about Ira Levin's writing style just caught me and didn't let me go until I finished the book. While some people claim that the plot is a bit far-fetched, it did not strike me that way. It does not seem like science fiction at all, simply a slight extrapolation. I never watched the movie that goes by the same title, so I cannot comment on how it follows or does not follow the book.I did not read this book; I listened to the audiobook, as read by Simon Vance.

            "My one-phrase rundown: a dated but well-penned and addictive tale of suspenseI read this book for two reasons: one, it was escapism conveniently located in the \u2018free paperback\u2019 bin at the library, and secondly as a minor nod to my father. My dad had a bookshelf brimming with cold-war and spy novels, and I vaguely remember him telling me about the plot of the book when I was a kid.Associating it with my father probably places me in the last generation which can connect with the book, involving as it does a Jewish Nazi-hunter discovering diabolical Nazis plotting a 4th Reich from their South American strongholds in the late 1970s. To many young people, WWII is ancient history rendered irrelevant by 9/11 and the newest version of the iPhone. I was stunned when recent interviews with Japanese teens revealed that virtually none recognized the date when the A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; I should grudgingly admit that a similar survey in a US shopping mall would likely show the same response to December 7th, 1941.Well, call me old and Twitter\u2013illiterate, but I found surviving Nazis officers appealing as bad guys. Face it, Aryans in SS uniforms are pretty easy to vilify, and by extension, easy for readers of all cultures to virtuously despise, while our current social apprehensions revolve around ambiguity. It\u2019s further chilling to think that the reprehensible Dr. Mengele was still alive in the jungles of Brazil and Paraguay when this book was written.The slight jump in medical and biotechnology needed to create the premise was undoubtedly much more sci-fi in 1976 than it is today. While the debate still swings back and forth between \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018nurture\u2019, it was not very long ago that the White House banned some biotech research based on fear and misunderstanding. From that standpoint, I can forgive some of the fears expressed by characters in the book, which sounded a lot like arguments made in 2003 by people who should have known better. Even though the book involved detailing places, characters and organizations with which I was unfamiliar, the story progressed smoothly and quickly; Levin\u2019s writing style is comprehensive without impeding flow. Stephen King compared Levin to a Swiss watchmaker. And despite the fact that I was only mildly sentient when the book was written, I\u2019ll be damned if Levin didn\u2019t write a fun, engaging, and slightly creepy, page-turner.",
            "It was a total surprise to me how much I enjoyed this book! It was a well written thriller with a good amount of suspense and interesting thought experiments to back it up. The somewhat predictable thus anticlimactic ending was slightly disappointing but I still totally recommend you read it! It made me really interested in learning more about Mengele as a person and I've already watched some documentaries on his life and experiments he performed on humans. The fact that he really existed made this book even better - despite his slightly absurd plans.",

            "One of the books from my childhood. I first saw the movie in 1979 and loved it. I was just a kid and failed to realize that the movie was totally over the top. I realize it now and I still like to watch it now and again. Excuse the digression. After seeing the movie I read the book. My parents belonged to The Book of the Month Club and the Mystery Guild book club back then and our library was full of the cheap hardbacks made  exclusively for book club members. But ,regardless of the low quality book binding, my parent's memberships gave me access to a vast number of mainstream novels from the seventies.  The Boys from Brazil  is one of the books that I devoured. At the time I found it a fascinating and horrifying prospect. Cloning was getting lots of attention in the seventies and a (seemingly) resurgent Nazi movement was causing some real concern. The concept of cloning Hitler just blew my mind as a kid. It was a fascinating concept. Many were convinced that there was a Fourth Reich in South America and it was just a matter of time before the world's nations would find themselves dealing with another Nazi menace. No doubt this fear added kick to Levin's novel. As it did for William Goldman's classic novel Marathon Man. It is now known that the so-called Fourth Reich in South America was just a scattered and weak community of war criminals hiding in fear (see the story of the real Joseph Mengele) and German ex-patriats singing Horst Wessel & Duetschland Uber Alles  over their beer and bratwurst while swapping war stories.

            "This book has everything I could hope for in a romance. It's a beautifully written love story, is intensely moving, and has deep, layered and completely developed characters. I enjoyed everything about it.It's a story about forbidden love and also one about faith. Geoffrey D'Aubrey returns as Lord to the home he ran from as a child. With him he brings his wife. His beautiful, cynical, lonely and battered wife Anne. War and soldiering are the only things Geoffrey truly loves. Before they've barely moved in he leaves Anne to fight another senseless battle. He leaves his horse and her (and in that order) in the care of his childhood friend Christy - a minister.Christy is gentle, kind, caring, loving and he and Anne become fast friends despite their differences in faith (she's an atheist). They have a great time joking about their differences and are open and honest with each other. Despite their attempts to avoid and deny it they fall in love but are both such! honorable people they refuse to do anything about it - until Geoffrey is reported dead. But before they can live happily ever after they must struggle through some horribly bleak times.I ached for this couple as they suffered through so much darkness and pain. This book is so good that it haunts me still. I don't say this often, and haven't said it in a long while, but if you haven't read this already go find it immediately. ",
            "To Love and to Cherish was a bit of a departure from most historical romances that I have read. Christian Morrell- \u2018Christy\u2019 to all the people who loved him- was the vicar of a small mining town. He was born and raised in Wyckerley. The townspeople, an eclectic lot, filled his void of loneliness. An illness, a new birth, an argument or gossip between friends were just a few matters that encompassed his day. He loved what he did but he never felt worthy of his position. He believed in God with his whole heart but he fretted that his parishioners did not truly understand what he preached. And he had never discovered love- the constant and enduring kind his parents had shared. When the story opened, Christy\u2019s best friend, Geoffrey, had returned home after years away. Whereas Christy had loving parents, Geoffrey\u2019s childhood was a nightmare. His mother had abandoned him and his father was a cruel person. Geoffrey took the brunt of his father\u2019s bitterness. It left him with deep emotional scars that traveled into adulthood and molded his existence. In addition, he was different from the best friend Christy once remembered. Time and distance had changed him. Now married, the new Lord D\u2019Aubrey greeted Christy with a questionable happiness. What the reverend soon surmised was the marriage between Geoffrey and his wife, Anne, was off-kilter. It was a troubled union with deep secrets. I. Liked. Christy. He was a good man but very human. He struggled with his friendship with Geoffrey and Anne. Because of this, I can\u2019t continue without writing spoilers. I only hope I see more of him in To Have and To Hold.",
            "You know how there are 5 star book and there are book that are so good you want to make a whole new category for them?This is one of those.The story was so sweet you wanted to sight after most of the scenes. But it never got really diabetic even thou the characters fell in love rather quickly. The hero and heroine had so much between them and still it was never less real or a cliche.The hero is...he is...i just love him. Not like. I am IN love with him. His looks, his deeds and way of thinking but mostly his soul. When Anna in the end falls on her knees and prays she says the real truth 'Please God save your greatest creation'. He deserved his happy ending more that any hero I read about.Even thou the heroines husband was at first drawn up half evil the author makes the best ever move-she makes him lovable. In the final scenes when he almost rapes Ann I cried. For him,for her,for them...I wished there was a way for them to be together. I even wish that he did not take the gun even thou Cristy would suffer without Anna. But Geoffry needed her then. And I loved Anna for asking him to stay. I love the author even more for making Geoffrey fall in love with Ann when it was too late for everything. Not because it was his just punishment but because it was written in the light of so much love, seeing as how all three of them really did care for one another. It was late for Geoffrey and Ann from the first days of their marriage. But the author redeems it all with the pure and wonderful love of Cristy and Anna.Before I finish and usher everybody I know to read this book I have to add: I was stunned speechless by the diary entries. This bold move was a very good one and it shows that the author knew what she was doing. Diary entries rarely work, but here they were a good plot device and a nice whay to really be inside Anna's thoughts.Now go read it. :)",
            "The writing was nice.One of the main attractions for To Love and to Cherish, in fact. Patricia Gaffney's neat, elegant prose saved this novel from the donation bin. She also conveys love in a realistic fashion compared to 99 percent of historical romances. I actually believed Anne and Christy (that's the hero) were in love, and I believe I've only said that once or twice before of a historical romance. I've bemoaned grand declarations before because, frankly, it doesn't take much talent or sincerity to paraphrase Shakespeare's lines -women in the 16th century died at 40, m'kay, Romeo's nothing to emulate- or exaggerate. Anne and Christy exchange those declarations occasionally, but mostly, they convince the reader as a couple because of the way they think of each other first, in a practical, even self-interested fashion. More than once, Anne or Christy thought, She felt bad for John",

            "It's a rare author who can make a truly good, selfless, godly and religious man into an interesting and sexy hero -- one whose beliefs don't make him insufferable when you don't necessarily share them as a reader. Who can create the perfect foil for this kind of hero in a woman who is a cynical, bitter, depressed atheist yearning, whether she knows it or not, for friendship, love, and community. Who is capable of writing a villain who isn't just a roadblock to the hero and heroine's happily ever after, but a believable, nuanced, and even heartbreaking character in his own right, in spite of the unlikeable and even wicked things he does. Who can bring an entire village of secondary characters to life, giving all the people we meet personalities and lives of their own, even if we're only seeing those lives in brief snatches. Patricia Gaffney is good. Very, very good. I love her lyrical, evocative writing style and found myself highlighting passage after passage in my Kindle.There were things I wasn't crazy about. The middle of the novel loses a little steam as the conflict veers into a moral conundrum for the hero that might be a little difficult for most modern readers to relate to. There's also a big plot twist about 3/4 of the way through the book that seemed much too convenient, plot-wise, in terms of the timing -- though I forgave it when it led to an increase in the angst and tension of the story and to some of my favorite sections of the book. Some of the things that happened toward the end of the novel were gut-wrenching and so emotional. I teared up several times before the story reached its conclusion.I feel like I'm being super vague. Here, read this for more details, it says a lot of the things I didn't. I can see why this book is considered a historical romance classic -- it's pretty wonderful. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the Wyckerley trilogy.",

            "The second book in this trilogy has been on a few book lists over the years that had me anticipating it. But because I'm me and have to read in order, I needed to start with book one. I didn't have many expectations and wondered at a trilogy in which the only book I'd heard of or seen mentioned was the second book. But I'm so glad that I did read this book first. It ended up being a beautifully written, complex, layered, character-driven love story. The way everything unfolded, the conversations the main characters had, all made this a very rich experience for me. I mean, this was a romance between a minister and an atheist (who calls herself an agnostic to soften the blow), and the theological conversations, debates, etc were really fascinating to me. These types of explorations and differences between people is one of the reasons that I love to read. If not for a few minor quibbles on my end, I think it would have been a 5 star read. I am looking forward to spending more time in the town of Wyckerley.",
            "This book was among the top of my watchlist for already a few years, as it came highly recommended by several reader friends extolling the wonderful writing, unusual but deeply moving story and characters. Honestly the praises were so unanimously laudatory that I was afraid of starting it, fearing that my expectations were built too high.Indeed I understood where those praises derived from. However I did not manage to be as taken by the book that I would have liked. The writing was indeed very refined, but to my opinion, might even appear a bit detached and cold. It might just be that I was not in the right mood to read this book, but I'm really not sure a better mood might have been enough for it to succeed in reaching my very limited keepers-shelf. This was obviously not a standard and easy-going romance. The heroine was already married, unhappily at that, when she met and fell in love with her husband's childhood friend. This latter was a pastor, which prevented them from enjoying an easy elopement and life in sin but freedom. Add to that several secrets relating to the husband and the reasons behind his falling out with his wife, several debates between the heroine and the pastor regarding faith, as she was atheist/agnostic at best and enjoyed debating. I really appreciated nonetheless that those debates and overall the religion environment was very far from preaching or taking positions and for that the detached and colder writing worked perfectly for me.In the end, it's a nice story with some predictible elements in it, the main characters seem quite real, with their failings made quite obvious but extremely likable. However I did not completely root for them and that's the reason behind my rating.Which would be a 3.5, if I could.",
            "Reviewed for THC Reviews4.5 stars The first Patricia Gaffney book I read was Wild at Heart",
            "Christy Morrell is the vicar of Wyckerley (the small town which is also the setting of To Have and to Hold). When his childhood friend Geoffrey Verlaine returns to Wyckerly upon the death of his father, Christy's faith is sorely tested by Geoffrey's caprices and by his own strong attraction to Geoffrey's wife, Anne. Unfortunately, Anne's past life has made her an atheist, and even when it seems that they can be together, their different beliefs may keep them apart.It's really refreshing to read a romance in which the hero isn't a rake, reformed or otherwise, and I quite liked reserved, wry Anne, whom we get to know better through diary entries interspersed with the main third-person narrative. Though there are some dramatics around Geoffrey, this story is much less fraught and angsty than To Have and to Hold and takes advantage of a lovely village setting which gives it a more pastoral, low-key charm. I can't say I was quite convinced by the resolution, but I was so entranced by the characters that it didn't really matter.",
            "Actual rating 3.5 stars. I would rate this higher except....I could not connect with the two main protagonists. Two of my favorite tropes are marriage of convenience and young love separated and reconnecting, of which this book satisfies one of them. However, the marriage of inconvenience is between the heroine and a minor character and not much is explored there for me to feel for the heroine. The surprise toward the end was not really a surprise as it was pretty obvious. The angst that was promised between Christy and Anna did not really materialize for me. The writing was beautiful and lyrical",

            " I only read the book so that I can read the second in the series: To Have and To HoldI have an obsession about reading in order :) I did not expect much from this book, but boy was I surprised! I would have rated this 5 stars, just for the last quarter of this book, but it did drag in the middle. Plus there was a real ick factor towards the end. Lots of sexual tension and the love scenes were just mmmmm... The descriptions of this little English village were beautiful. I felt I could just see it through Anne's eyes. Her loneliness and desperation were palpable and I truly felt her emotions.  Christy was just so adorable and yummy and I knew he would be the one to save Anne. Plus you have to love a man who wore all his emotions on his sleeve.  This book was different in that, there was a lot of talk about God's love that read almost like a Christian book, but there was some heavy steam in there and I can't think of any other book I have read that had both of these factors.  The best part of this book was the last quarter, and I believe I could read that part over and over again and just love it each and every time. I am looking forward to reading the other two in this series and hope they are as good :)",

            "To Love and to Cherish is the first novel where I encountered a hero who is godly, to be specific the hero is a vicar. It is quite strange since I\u2019ve read many romance novels and this is the first with a religious slant. Love and marriage are one of the themes deeply explored in religion, particularly Christianity, authors can benefit from exploring this angle more. The author was able to effectively integrate the themes of Christianity into the character of her hero. We have a hero who is definitely virile but in control of his passions and that makes for an interesting premise when the very much married and unavailable heroine appears in his life. It is a recipe for tragedy and some interesting twists and turns. I really like the character of the vicar. He actually had a life before his vocation and had done some minor \u201csins\u201d but let the book tell you. The heroine professes to admire his intellect when she listens to his sermons. His sermons are described to be well thought out philosophical discussions. The hero as I see it is a bookish, virile man, now that is something for the imagination. In short, he is simply perfect, like Clark Kent of Superman. The hero is perfect intellectually and morally and even his love for the heroine is perfect. He has been convincing her to marry him for the most part. Perfection can be boring but the trick here is when something is so perfect there can only be the delicious downfall and it does occur in the story. This is what makes the story riveting because other than the romantic side of it we wonder how the author will resolve the characters\u2019 moral issues. The pair have an affair thinking that the heroine\u2019s husband is already dead. This part of the story is a delicious courtship. Rather than wooing the heroine with biblical passages our hero is wooing her with kinky poetry and kisses to get her to marry him. He has strictly forbidden an affair: no affair before an engagement. Our heroine here is something of an atheist but this really not a major conflict in the story because intuitively we know that things will just turn around. The real challenge for the heroine is that her marriage had been tragic, she doesn\u2019t believe in marriage and had been coaxing the vicar for an affair. He gives in eventually but only after he squeezed out a yes from her. The downfall came down like a sledgehammer when it turns out our heroine\u2019s husband is alive and what happens next is high drama and again just let the book tell you. Since this is the romance genre the reader is always walking on a tightrope with a safety net underneath: know that things will work out for the best in the end. Religion is often an unexplored territory in the romance genre, it has its own type of idealized hero or heroine as expressed in the vicar and it\u2019s a good thing to imagine and explore if an author is committed enough for the endeavor. A part of the charm of the book is the author's style. Some passages use the epistolary technique giving the reader a further glimpse into the psyche and turmoils of the characters.",
            "high two, low three starsa thoughtful, emotionally dark examination of a clashing in love of a modern, semi-nihilistic sensibility versus/with a conservative, religious, community-centered sensibilityoften quite touchingi very much appreciate how the author sensitively explored the validity and, really, extremes of each of the two main protagonists' psychological and cultural limits (it reminded me a bit in this sense of flowers from the storm). that said, her villain was just completely indiscernible to me; i could not locate his depth of alienation and rage. to be fair, the author did work to situate/explicate his extreme behavior, but it read to me as Bad Guy Fairy Tale Villain rather than something genuinely distressing but recognizable. this diminished a lot of my enjoyment in the tale, slashed much of the dramatic tension, and made me invest less in the protagonists' eventual union.still, a fine book, and i would absolutely be sympathetic to another readers super high review."

            "Buddy was a rabbit with great big ears. His father had a beautiful big nose and a wonderful sense of smell. His mother had beautiful big teeth and could chomp carrots with the best of them. Unfortunately, Buddy\u2019s beautiful big ears did not make him a good listener. Buddy got very distracted and so he just didn\u2019t listen. His parents asked him to bring some squash home from the market; he brought a basket of wash instead. When they sent him for tomatoes, he came home with potatoes. His parents tried everything, talking louder, softer, standing right in front of him, but nothing seemed to work. One day Buddy\u2019s parents gave him permission for his first long hop alone. He was so excited he didn\u2019t listen to their warning, \u201cAt the end of the road, there are two paths. The path to the left will lead you around the pond and back home. But the path to the right will lead you to the cave of the Scruffy Varmint.\u201d At the end of the road Buddy hopped right. Right into the Scruffy Varmint! Will Buddy survive his encounter with the snarling, mangy Scruffy Varmint or will he be made into bunnyrabbit soup?The message of this rollicking tale is that listening is important. Lester\u2019s text is a mixture of snappy dialogue and fast-paced narrative, which keeps this book from sounding teachy-preachy. The characters are depicted humorously in the text and illustrations and the exaggerated results of Buddy's lack of listening will elicit many a giggle. Munsinger\u2019s illustrations are brightly colored and pen and ink lines provide definition and detail. The anthropomorphic animals are dressed in solid colors and much is conveyed with facial expressions and body language. For all his faults, Buddy is an endearing protagonist and Munsinger never misses an opportunity to incorporate Buddy\u2019s big ears into her compositions.

            "Another clever story from Helen Lester. I love the characters that she creates. They are always so quirky and odd. Buddy, the rabbit with big ears and a problem with listening, is not exception. I really enjoyed the story and the Scruffy Varmint was very amusing. I felt bad for him, having to put up with such lousy help, but Buddy eventually learned a lesson, even if it was at the expense of the Scruffy Varmint's soup. ",

            "Title: Listen Buddy Author: Helen Lester Illustrator: Lynn MunsingerGenre: Predictable Theme(s): Rabbits, listening Opening Line/Sentence: Buddy\u2019s father had a beautiful big nose. He was a great sniffer. Brief Book Summary: Listen Buddy is centralized around a bunny rabbit named Buddy. Buddy has very long, large ears but fails to listen and comprehend with whatever his parents ask of him. When Buddy decides to go out for a \u2018hop\u2019 into unknown territory, he ends up in trouble. He would have been able to avoid the trouble had he listened and remembered which direction to go down the path to safety as told to him by his parents. Buddy ends up making it home safely and pays closer listening attention. Professional Recommendation/Review #1: Phyllis Kenemer, Ph.D. (Children\u2019s Literature)Buddy has big, beautiful ears, but he does not use them to listen accurately. He comes home from his errand to the vegetable stand with a basket of wash instead of a basket of squash; he buys fifteen potatoes instead of fifteen tomatoes; and he hands his father a hen instead of a pen. His parent\u2019s constant request to Listen, Buddy goes unheeded. On the day that Buddy asks for permission to go on a long hop, his parents warn him about turning left at the fork in the road to avoid an encounter with Scruffy Varmint. Buddy does not hear them and hops right up to the varmint\u2019s cave. Buddy offers to help Scruffy Varmint with his preparations for soup, not realizing that he is the intended main ingredient! Buddy hands Varmint briarwood instead of firewood, flowers instead of flour, and five inches of salt instead of five pinches. After all the confusing components have been added to the pot, Buddy obligingly throws the mixture in the fire when asked to put the soup on the fire. The angry varmint howls, I will have bunny rabbit soup. Buddy listens that time, and he hops home faster than he has ever moved in his life. From then on, Bunny listens! The attractive watercolor illustrations give personality to the characters and add to the humor. This is a fun choice for story time. Professional Recommendation/Review #2: Hazel Rochman (Booklist) Buddy is a daydreaming rabbit who never listens. When his mother asks for a basket of squash, he comes with a basket of wash. When his father asks for a pen, Buddy brings him a hen. One day Buddy meets the Scruffy Varmint monster, who nearly makes him into rabbit soup, but Buddy tricks and blunders his way out of trouble and wakes up to the world around him. Kids will enjoy the slapstick and the word jokes. Munsinger's joyful watercolors extend the farce of the disaster scenarios: in one wonderful scene we see that Buddy has sawed off a piece of bed when he's asked for a slice of bread. Use this with French's retelling of the old English folktale Lazy Jack, about a sleepy kid bewildered by adult instructions.Response to Two Professional Reviews:Both professional reviews point out the comedy that the book presents with Buddy failing to listen to the directions he is given. For example, Buddy brings potatoes instead of tomatoes. The reviews also pointed out close attention to the watercolor detailed paintings of the book. Although predictable, the book is fun and grabs the attention of the reader. The book teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of listening. Evaluation of Literacy Elements: As previously mentioned, the book has many rhyming words such as potato and tomato, squash and wash, and pinch and inch. The watercolor illustrations throughout the book are skilled and impressive. The plot is predictable. Buddy does not listen and then faces a time of conflict, which then makes him reconsider the importance of his listening skills. Consideration of Instructional Application:The most important takeaway from this book is about listening. If an individual does not listen to instructions or advice, they may end up in a position they do not want to be in. A listening activity with students would be beneficial. Giving directions only once as opposed to two, three or four times would be a way to improve attention, listening, and respect for the teachers and others.",
            "Am I the only one who is rankled by the lesson of this book? A bunny who has obvious difficulties in listening, constantly messing up, and they just let it continue with a 'Listen Buddy!' rant that even I was tuning out.No discussion of why he was having difficulties listening, what everyone could do to work through the problem. Instead, he's sent on a task that he obviously fails. From there, he ends up in scrape after scrape with a stranger, only 'learning' his lesson after the stranger threatens to eat him. Runs home and listens from that point forward.Just... what? For a kid who has difficulties listening, the only option is to be put in a dangerous situation where you could be abused or killed? There wasn't a more controlled environment to teach the kid that not listening could be dangerous? 'Don't worry, kids, your parents can be negligent too, but you better listen!'The only educationally appropriate mark I can give it is that it has a lot of repetition and wordplay to expand vocabulary, hence the 2 stars. ",
            "Even though Buddy has the BIGGEST, most BEAUTIFUL bunny ears, he isn't very good at listening. Need a slice of bread? Careful, you might get a slice of bed! Need a pen? Well I hope you like eggs, because Buddy will bring you a PEN! One day, Buddy gets to go on a long hop, but has to remember to listen to the directions. When the expected happens, Buddy's problem gets him into trouble with the Scruffy Varmint, who enlists his help making a stew. This is a fantastic read aloud to keep kids hanging on every word and to teach the idea of plot and problem in a story. This was my first ever read aloud to class, and it was magic to see those kindergarteners so engaged and interested in the story! A week later when we were reviewing it, I was so impressed with how much they remembered and had learned. Fantastic writing and illustrations. "

        "description": "The incredible true story of Alexander Gordon Laing and the race to discover Timbuktu during the early part of the 19th century\u2013\u2013a time when the African continent was still largely uncharted.In the first decades of 19th century, no place burned more brightly in the imagination of European geographers\u2013\u2013and fortune hunters\u2013\u2013than the lost city of Timbuktu. Like the mythical city of El Dorado, the very real Timbuktu held the promise of wealth and fame. Whoever got there first was guaranteed worldwide renown. Yet, though many had tried, no European explorer had been there and returned since the Middle Ages. In fact, Europeans knew more about the geography of the moon than they did of North and Central Africa. In 1824, the French Geographical Society offered a cash prize for the first expedition from any nation to return from Timbuktu. The announcement fueled the already intense rivalry between the French and the British for control of the African interior. The British, unwilling to depend on the fate of one explorer, sent several \"African travelers\" on their way.The Race for Timbuktu focuses on two of these men: Alexander Gordon Laing, the book's protagonist and \"voice,\" and Hugh Clapperton, the man who would become his greatest rival. Though their superiors had hoped the men would work together, instead the two became fierce opponents, each convinced that discovery of Timbuktu was his fate alone.The Race for Timbuktu follows Laing and Clapperton on their arduous journeys across the unforgiving Sahara, in constant battle against the elements, illness, attack, and time, to be the first white man to reach the fabled gates of Timbuktu. The story of their expeditions also serves as a narrative history of the European colonization of Africa including the competition between England and France to stake out African claims, the collusions of Arabs and Africans against Europeans over the slave trade, and the violent confrontation of Islam with Christianity. As a result of the \"Great Scramble\" launched by African travelers' missions, in less than a century, nearly every square yard of Africa would be occupied by European nations.The Race for Timbuktu offers a close personal look at the extraordinary people and pivotal events of 19th century African exploration that changed the course of history and the shape of the modern world.",

            "This is a story of European, specifically British, exploration of the African interior in the late 18th and early 19th century. At one point the book shows a 1829 map of Africa, and it was striking how much white space was on it. The Moon was better mapped--because you could study the Moon with a telescope--trying to get to the interior of Africa if you were a European was a different story. (The slave trade wasn\u2019t conducted by Europeans in the African interior but by Africans themselves. Europeans primarily only hugged the coasts of Sub-Saharan Africa until late in the 19th century.) The Race for Timbuktu is a story of exploration and cultures colliding worthy of Star Trek--only without the Prime Directive and not just the Red Shirts drop like flies. I thought the book did well on several levels. The explorers themselves come across as distinct personalities. Kryza quotes one historian of African exploration in the 1960s as saying that: \u201cIt remains difficult, in the checkered history of geographical discovery, to find a more odious man than Dixon Denham.\u201d Having read Hochschild\u2019s King Leopold\u2019s Ghost, I would have thought it was hard to beat Henry Morton Stanley on that score, but I think Denham as portrayed by Kryza at least comes close. Other explorers such as Mongo Park, Lyons, Clapperton and Laing were more sympathetic, but just as interesting. I was also fascinated by the delineation of the connections between the loss of the American colonies, the push to end the slave trade, and how it drove British expeditions to find the lost city of Timbuktu and trace the course of the Niger River. The author does a great job in conveying what a barrier the Sahara Desert on one side and the tropical diseases of the Congo River basin on the other side presented and how they isolated Timbuktu. Timbuktu, in what is today Mali is on the banks of the Niger and the southern border of the Sahara was a legendary city where \u201ccamel met canoe.\u201d It was \u201clikely founded around 1100\u201d and at one point had a population reaching 100,000, was in its heyday fabulously wealthy, and had boasted an important center of Islamic scholarship in Medieval times. If I had one disappointment, it is we actually don\u2019t spend much time or space on Timbuktu itself--this is a book about the journey, not the destination. Kryza claims he is \u201cno scholar, and this is not a scholarly book\u201d but he does include a bibliography and extensive notes on each chapter pointing to his sources. The book was entertaining, but felt solid in its facts.",
            "History is brought to life in this little gem of non-fiction about British and Scottish explorers of the early 19th century. It follows the history of attempts to locate Timbuktu and efforts to map the route of the Niger river. Goals included putting an end to slave trading and establishing new commerce. The book could also have been entitled \u201c1001 Ways to Die a Painful Death.\u201d Turns out, the \u201cbest\u201d routes to get to Timbuktu were traveling through the up-to-150-degree heat and vast rocky expanse of the Sahara Desert or crossing swamps and dense forests with hordes of disease-carrying mosquitos from the coast. Death could (and did) come from numerous foul means: dysentery, malaria, dehydration, marauding bandits, territorial tribes, fanatic Islamists, and a variety of potentially lethal fevers. The first several chapters describe previous journeys into the African interior, setting the stage for the rivalry to come, including a couple in which:\u201cEngland\u2019s best and brightest had been wiped out in both of the expeditions (65 percent of the British contingent of 117 men died in Africa, while many of the rest were terminally ill when they landed in England).\u201dThe middle chapters arrive at the focus of the book, primarily about two men striving to become the first to reach Timbuktu, and claim not only the prize of 10,000 francs offered by the French Geographical Society, but the accolades and prestige which would inevitably follow such an achievement:\u201cUntil that August day in 1826 when the first white man in three centuries is known to have walked through the gates of Timbuktu, some dozen European explorers tried to find the city. For two of these, Captain Hugh Clapperton and Major Alexander Gordon Laing, winning this prize became an intensely personal competition, crossing that thin line that separates a passionate but realizable dream from an irrational and dangerous obsession.\u201dThese chapters are filled with striking descriptions and colorful, larger-than-life people. Not simply conveying a historical record, the author inserts vivid narrative that conjures an image of place:\u201cNight fell quickly in the Tripolitanian desert. The sky overhead became rusty; the setting sun dimmed. As the light failed, the sky passed from copper to bronze but remained metallic as the sun\u2019s embers were overtaken by the moon\u2019s milky shimmer.\u201dThis book is filled with adventure, courage, intrigue, politics, betrayal, and memorable people. The author is adept at conveying the personal characteristics of the individuals, both the admirable and the unpleasant. There\u2019s even a love story embedded in the pages, which adds poignancy and human impact to those left behind. The final few chapters recount the aftermath. These chapters, while necessary, were not quite as riveting as those in the heart of the book. Recommended to readers interested in exploration, African/British history, or true-life adventures of a bygone era.",
            "Let's see. We need someone to explore a new region with zero possibility of returning. You will die through contraction of awful tropical disease, starvation in a vast desert or murder at the hands of xenophobic desert nomads. Volunteers?Well, yes, there are, if you want to count 18th century Brits. I don't know what compelled them to go, but I do not think you would get any moderns to do so unless they had been told they only had six months to live. However, for the pre-Victorian Brits, the desire to explore new regions and the attendant fame compelled them to try to be the first to visit the fabled city of Timbuktu in what is now Mali.Timbuktu was believed to be filled with treasures and no white man had seen it since the Roman era. That an American had actually been there and reported what he'd found in the 1790s did not count-He was a freedman and not white. Also, he said there was nothing much there-and that couldn't right.The Race mentioned in the title was the competition to reach Timbuktu to win a prize offered by the French Geograhical Society in 1824. Earlier than that",
            "Really enjoyed this. Back in the 18th and 19th century, more was known about the face of the moon than the interior of Africa. Good fact that. So Victorians, with their sense of order and derring do - combined of course with superiority and racism set out to discover the lost city of Timbuktu (which may have been a surprise to its residents, who must have felt they always knew where they were). Anyway, well know fact in those days that you weren't anywhere until a white bloke wandered in and said you were now an official somewhere.Those guys were hardy, resourceful, plucky, greedy, evil, good or some combination, but they were all a bit mental. And this is their story, concentrating on Alexander Gordon Laing, the first man to reach Timbuktu, as well as previous expeditions - (Mungo Park and the Denham, Clapperton and Oudney expedtiions- with Denham winning the dubious award of most odious malevolent person to step out of Britain in that (possibly most) era. And frankly I'd include fiction as well as non-fiction there.Anyway, the events this chronicals are hard edged explorations, dangers and dealings with the locals, and with the UK Consul in Tripoli, Warrington, a major (in every sense) character throughout the whole period, it would actually be difficult to make these larger than life characters dull. Which thankfully the book doesn't do. Quite the opposite, it picks up pace through to Timbuktu, and I found really keeps the interest for a lengthy debate started by Warrington accusing the foul French had absconded with some priceless papers that clouded relations, and made things...rather interesting.Clips along nicely, with good use of the original surviving letters, but with an accessible, not overly academic style (but copious notes if you like that sort of thing). Recommended.",
            "Exciting account of the first recorded European experience with a fable city, the reality and the tragic aftermath...",
            "Having been piqued with a recent fetish for African exploration and discovery by Europeans as well as the pre-existing cultures, kingdoms and peoples, I grabbed for The Race for Timbuktu, a book I acquired long ago just as a similar desire flamed out and left it gathering dust on my to-read shelf.So, when my yearning was rekindled this past year, I eagerly snatch up The Race for Timbuktu, ready to dive in. (You see, wife, this is why I get so many more books when I still haven\u2019t started the other ones I got the last time \u2026 reading the right book is about opportunity, mood, and availability of text--I can\u2019t always predict the first two, but I can facilitate the latter. This is a conversation we\u2019ve had before that I\u2019ve failed to adequately explain, so this book is kind of my star witness. No further questions \u2026 and no cross examination!)For me, however, I more felt that this would be a dutiful, fact-finding read. No one had recommended it. I didn\u2019t really research it at all besides doing a general search on the Internet and figuring, through the description, that this ought to cover things pretty well. Basically, I felt that I would enjoy the information I gathered from it, but it would not be the kind of book I\u2019d try to foist upon others.Boy was I surprised when I actually found the background info on African exploration being fascinating, if not exciting. It\u2019s tragic and harrowing how many waves of explorers got swallowed up by the interior of Africa \u2026 and how relentless the British/Europeans were in rounding up and sending more into the front lines of battle, even without waiting for the success or failure of the previous.Then Kyrza gets to the meat of the tale: the breakdown of Clapperton and Laing\u2019s individual quests to find the mouth of the Niger and to locate the legendary African city, Timbuktu. I was in awe. Both of them faced daunting, though highly different, tasks (jungle survival versus desert survival). Both of them succeeded in some measure thanks to their passionate determination. Most of all, Kyrza allows the most distinct character of these stories to take precedence--the setting. Whether in the disease-ridden, jungle-mobbed West African coast or in the heat-seared sprawling expanse-of-nothing Saharan desert, Kyrza makes you feel the harsh reality of these fringe areas of Mother Nature\u2019s most uncultured side.So amazing was his storytelling, that at one point I thought I had to be in fiction story territory. One of the characters being left for dead, yet not only surviving but pushing on. Later, I would question the true ending of the story for a couple of chapters, fully expecting a twist ending in the vein of a mystery novel. So devastating were some events, one in particular, that after reading, it threw me off for half the day as I mourned for a tragic turn of events that seemed unfair to me. What a wonderful mixture of researching a story worth telling, and then finding a way to tell it right.Having said that, Kyrza is not perfect. In fact, in some ways, he feels quite amateur. Some of the cobbling together of tales are sloppy enough that they needlessly repeat details, chapters apart from each other. The focus of some chapters seem to be built into a bigger whole, while others are strangely isolated or thematically irrelevant. When I read his afterword and saw how many hands touched the manuscript, how many people helped to decide the direction of the research and narrative, and his own journey and motivation in writing it, that made the discombobulated feel of the book make more sense, even if it did not fix some of the overarching problems.While that does affect the reading experience, however, Kyrza succeeds even where he may not intend to. The strength of the stories he innately sensed as being powerful, his own contribution to the inhospitable setting that is West Africa\u2019s interior, and the characters that he wisely allowed to tell the tale--all these make for an exciting, daredevil ride. In fact, it\u2019s so thrilling that you\u2019d read it for fiction enjoyment alone. But don\u2019t. Read it for enjoyment, and then be amazed that it\u2019s really non-fiction after all!",

This event, famous for its extravagance, was the introduction of Mali into the popular imagination \u2013 and economies \u2013 of the Islamic caliphates of old. Following the gilded trail back with Musa to Timbuktu were the emissaries, ambassadors and traders; the artisans and scholars and scam artists of powers great and small scrambling to find a place in Africa\u2019s \u201cEl Dorado\u201d. There, where the dry ocean of the Sahara meets the extensive expanse of black Africa, on a bend in the Niger River, sat the small trading post of Timbuktu \u2013 newly acquired by Musa\u2019s expanding empire. A perfect jumping off point \u2013 and an ideal meeting place of cultures \u2013 Timbuktu rapidly became an epicenter of trade and Islamic learning, with a university founded by Musa reaching 25,000 students and boasting libraries with almost half a million books (during a time when Oxford had only hundreds, maybe a thousand). A place where, it is fabled, the currency was not in gold or silver but in books. For a while Timbuktu flourished, but time and changing trading patters \u2013 and a Moroccan invasion \u2013 put an end to Timbuktu\u2019s preferential status as a city richer than London, Paris or Vienna.But the legend continued. Timbuktu, Africa\u2019s El Dorado, remained in the popular imagination of the Europeans as the elusive prize \u2013 if only they could find it.\u201cThe Race for Timbuktu\u201d by Frank Kryza is the story of one chapter of this search. Specifically, it is the story of how a group of British explorers tried to penetrate the dark heart of Africa. Braving Tuareg raids, desperate Saharan expanses devoid of water, disease, betrayal, tribal wars and Muslim Jihads a group of intrepid explorers sought to penetrate the unknown to arrive at last to Timbuktu.I like this story because, above all, it is a human story. Kryza delves into the personal travails of the travelers on their journey, never whitewashing their not insignificant interpersonal weaknesses, while nevertheless also highlighting the tremendous bravery and courage of conviction of these singular men as they competed for the great prize \u2013 to be the first white man to visit Timbuktu, and return. It is a hard story, because it is one of suffering and pain and betrayal. It is a disappointing story, because the characters themselves often leave so much to be desired. And it is a sad story because so many died on the journey; while for those who made it, their frustration as they enter Timbuktu to find that the glory days of that fabled city were centuries in the past is almost tangible.It is a story worth the read, because it marks the last chapter of Africa\u2019s isolation and the first chapter of Africa\u2019s place in the modern world \u2013 for good and for bad.",
            "The beginning and end of this book are difficult to get through. It's the juicy middle that's entertaining. The first third of the book works its way through a long line of unfortunate explorers. After a while, I found it tough to get invested in any character because I figured he wouldn't live more than a few pages. These stories demonstrated just how daunting it was to get to Timbuktu. It was satisfying when the author finally focused on a team that made some headway into the interior of the continent. I enjoyed hearing about their interactions with one another and with their African hosts. It was especially interesting to learn about African leaders' initial reactions upon meeting them. The Europeans were part extra-terrestrial and part ominous prelude to Africa's foreign relations. The anxiety was especially on the minds of those Africans who had heard about Great Britain's work in India. All this goes to show that there was a lot more to this book than a simple race to find an exotic city. It was a pivotal moment in history for two continents. The end of the book lost me though. It got really overbearing with the many details of the Timbuktu quest's post mortem. It was an unsatisfying conclusion in light of all the general themes that the author could have reinforced, touching on colonialism and European urges to gather Africa's resources. This was a good book, but you have to be willing to skim when the details get overwhelming.",
            "In some ways this is a brilliant book, in others it felt disappointing. Kryza's chops as a historian are more than sufficient. His descriptions of the people and places of 19th century Africa carry me there. I can find no fault in his prose or his writing. But when he writes the close of Lang's adventure, where the historical record is difficult to be certain about, Kryza does not stay with the explorer. Instead he relays knowledge of the events as they gradually surfaced to Lang's Wife and to his Father-in-Law. I wish Kryza had, instead, kept the narrative with Lang to the end, even though that would mean invention of further detail. This is a historical novel, and at the conclusion of the book, where I wanted it to be most like a novel, it because most like a history instead.I do want that story, the long silence, the controversy over the papers, in the story.Consider another historical novel I just recently read, Devil in the White City; the author explains in a footnote how he invented the personal, dramatic detail of a character's death. Surely any historian reading this would forgive Kryza's invention of the detail so the central figure in this tragedy would not die offstage?The book, taken as a whole, is well written and well researched. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys distant places or unknown histories."

        "description": "In the early 1990s people around the small town of Elkhorn, Wisconsin, claimed to see strange, hairy, wolf-headed creatures that sometimes walked upright and seemed not afraid of man. The canid sensation was soon dubbed Beast of Bray Road, after the location of the first reported sightings. Author Linda Godfrey began investigating this story and soon found herself in the middle of a national sensation. Nobody has ever been able to prove whether the beast is a flesh-and-blood werewolf or will-o'-the-wisp, demon dog, or noble animal. But the author gives the reader plenty to chew on. Make up your own mind, if you do so at all, only after the marrow has been extracted and well digested.",

        "reviews": [
            "This book ostensibly relates the stories of a werewolf-type creature seen in rural Wisconsin. Since the sightings were both brief and few, the book is mostly digression into historical precedent and speculation, as well as documenting the author's attempt to wrest a movie deal from the material. Its largest flaw, to me, is the author's total acceptance of eyewitness accounts as always genuine and accurate. The writing itself is well-done, and if you're interested in the topic, it seems a thorough gathering of the few available facts.",
            "It was OK. A fairly well-written account of how this beast blossomed into a national story. Disappointed about the poor sources - mostly general books and non-credible websites - which is strange for a journalist. I would quibble with several assertions, for example, why were large black cats even mentioned as they certainly don't fit. I wished for more serious research than this. It's the only decent source out there but rather weak overall. I would have rated 2.5 stars, right in the middle if that was possible.",
            "Linda Godfrey presents an entertaining study of the topic of wolf-like creatures like the one that was sighted in her home area of Southwest Wisconsin. The history of such creatures was well-researched, citing appearances around the country and in other parts of the world. She got into this subject as a small-town journalist simply reporting local stories but the accounts got picked up by other agencies and she has become somewhat of an expert on such things. In spite of her noteriety in the field of cryptozoology, her writing style is simple and often lighthearted which makes this an enjoyable read. Those who have heard her speak say that her presentations have the same flavor. I look forward to reading more of her work.",
            "In Wisconsin, some residents have reported seeing a creature that looks sort of like a werewolf. It's been sited along Bray Road a number of times. The author recounts the stories with a great deal of humor. She does believe the eye witnesses have seen something unusual. But, not wanting to be dogmatic",
            "Oh,  Linda S. Godfrey. I love your work so much but it never fails to frustrate me.  The Beast of Bray Road is not the easiest of Godfrey's books to track down. This was the monster sighting that got her career as a dogman enthusiast started, as she ended up covering the Beast of Bray Road werewolf beat back when it first took the news. This book documents the bulk of that experience, and what came after. Between the pages of this book you'll find a succinct history of dogman/werewolf/bigfoot/who knows sightings around the Bray Road/Wisconsin/Minnesota area and a small history of the media coverage of such events. As Godfrey's forays into this furry phenomena continue over the years she's dug her claws deeper into eyewitness testimony and what it might mean. This book does a little bit of that in the final chapter, but she leaves it all largely up to reader speculation. She doesn't try to figure out whether the sightings are good or bad, or what the creature might be after. This is simply establishing that there is something going on that is a bit more canid than ape. As always, I wish that Godfrey had a more in-depth book out on these topics - or that anyone would. I think there is a lot more historical work to be delved into - particularly when it comes to folklore surrounding cynocephali and werewolves etc. that is just not being done. Every time I open Godfrey's book I want more of that rather than her discussing the same sightings that I now know she's been trotting out since book one. Will it happen? I dunno. I still hope so. If not, maybe I'll have to write it.",
            "Having seen a tv program on this subject, I thought I\u2019d give this book a read. I enjoyed the show and my interest was piqued. I had not heard of this cryptid before.The book is probably best suited to readers who are not too familiar with cryptozoology, as the content might be a bit too familiar, other wise. I\u2019m not a crypto buff, so it was fine for me.The section specific to the Bray Rd Beast is only a relatively small portion of the book. Other sightings in the state and surrounding states are mentioned, overseas, modern and ancient. Werewolves, were animals, theories, media coverage etc are touched upon too. If you\u2019re looking for anything groundbreaking or in-depth, you will be dissatisfied with this book. But if you\u2019re mildly curious about cryptids in general you should find this book entertaining enough. I think it\u2019s strongest point was the author\u2019s tone which was mildly amusing. She neither lampooned nor took it all too seriously but hit a gently bemused medium."

            "Molly Moon Stops The World is about Molly Moon, an orphan with mind - blowing hypnotic powers. She is able to induce people using a procedure called hypnotic induction. After learning how to hypnotize people all over the world, rescuing her pet pug Petunia from being dog-napped, you'd think Molly would have had enough adventures to last a lifetime. However, the evildoers of the world simply aren't done doing evil. Molly soon finds herself on a plane to Los Angeles, where she and her best friend Rocky discover that Primo Cell, a powerful, rich public figure, has been controlling celebrities - and has learned how to stop time! Of course, that is not enough for Cell. Now he wants to be President of the United States! When Molly, Rocky and Petula the pug meet him at the Oscars they make some astonishing discoveries. Can Molly\u2019s mesmerizing eyes stop the most dangerous man in the world?   This book will take you on a heart stopping adventure filled with magical events. At the beginning of the book, it was quite boring as the writer describes too much about the characters of the book. The characters description was boring because they put too much adjectives in one sentence and I don\u2019t think that is that good .Although,I think that they described Molly Moon very well in the start of the book. But other than that, once I really got into the story, I could not put the book down, I couldn't wait to find out how Molly saved the world. At first, I felt as if I knew what was going to happen but then the book took me on a roller coaster ride which changed my initial thoughts about it and it even kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.The setting of the scenes in the book were quite interesting. I could picture every scene without a hitch due to the description of the book. I also think that the author\u2019s writing was also quite good because I could understand the story really well and this book is also very understandable for young kids. It has an even amount of flowery words and simple words. After I finished the book, I had learnt about 30 new words from it. It\u2019s always good to learn new things everyday and this book surely helped me increase my vocabulary!  In conclusion, I really enjoyed reading this book and I would totally recommend this book to young readers, probably from the age of 10-15. Overall, its a good book and it is totally worth your time to read it. Georgia Byng is an amazing author and I am looking forward to read more books written by her! ",

            "This hilarious series keeps you jumping and guessing. Molly Moon is quite the Spitfire and her dog Petula is always in the center of the action. Glad these two conquered another mystery! ",
            "Notable Content: A lot of New Age type stuff, which may be expected from a hypnotism series, but it's still of note."

It'll be more like general info that they just put in wherever, and by the time we see it we're like, well, thanks, that would have been really helpful to know 17 weeks ago when we were figuring it out on our own!

I know the authors say that babies can hit the milestones listed before or after the week they are mentioned, but it still stresses you out as a mom when you read something like, your baby should be sleeping x hours a night by now and your baby is not. Babies are just too variable for a week to week format to be very useful",
            "Disclaimer: I did not finish this book. However, the reason I've decided to stop reading is that I've found some misinformation that has made me worry unnecessarily. If you choose to read this just take everything with a grain of salt. ",
            "This book is really helping me and Steve feel better about bringing Baby Logan home. It has lots of good advice that is organized well",
            "The basic premise of this book just doesn\u2019t work. While you can have a month by month guide of things you *might* expect, having a week by week guide is incredibly restrictive and makes the assumption that all babies develop exactly the same way every week! It doesn\u2019t allow for individual personalities, temperaments, or strengths. This in turn leads to unrealistic expectations. And as others have pointed out, some of the information is just plain wrong! The especially baffling part is equating 4 weeks to 1 month, so that a 16 week baby is considered exactly 4 months. Most approaches to counting age in the first year recognize that a month is 4.5 weeks. Their insistence on a 4 week month skews the presented timeline even further.",
            "It's great to have a modern version of a baby's growth and medical updates on modern raising baby views. There are studies and helpful game ideas to play with baby. It's been very helpful while helping take care of our newest granddaughter."

        "description": "Christians have struggled with racial issues for centuries, and often inadvertently contribute to the problem. Many proposed solutions have been helpful, but these only take us so far. Adding to this complex situation is the reality that Christians of different races see the issues differently. Sociologist George Yancey surveys a range of approaches to racial healing that Christians have used and offers a new model for moving forward. The first part of the book analyzes four secular models regarding race used by Christians (colorblindness, Anglo-conformity, multiculturalism and white responsibility) and shows how each has its own advantages and limitations. Part two offers a new \"mutual responsibility\" model, which acknowledges that both majority and minority cultures have their own challenges, tendencies, and sins to repent of, and that people of different races approach racial reconciliation and justice in differing but complementary ways. Yancey's vision offers hope that people of all races can walk together on a shared path--not as adversaries, but as partners.",

            "America has a long and troubling history of racial inequalities and injustices. As I write this review, we as a nation are in the midst of reckoning with some of our racial legacies due to the unfortunate murders of George Floyd, Ahmad Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. These killings, which have stayed in our national conscience has forced many of us to reconsider how race effects our own lives and that of society. The need for racial reconciliation has existed for as long as America has been a country and now more and more people are recognizing and pushing for this reconciliation to happen. Once we agree that a problem exists, we find ourselves faced with another daunting problem: how shall we achieve racial reconciliation? A variety of different voices are calling for different solutions, many of which are contradictory. How will racial reconciliation be achieved, and what specifically should the response of the church be? We cannot deny our failures in this area, but we are also unsure of what to do.In the midst of these questions I found myself reading Beyond Racial Gridlock by sociologist George Yancey. This is not a new book, having originally been published in 2006, but the message of the book is a timely one. The talk about racism we hear today is needed, but also incomplete. This is because the solutions proposed all contain some deficiency. They all lack a distinctly Christian understanding of race. All of the dominant approaches are secular in origin, even though all are blessed by different Christians. What is needed, according to Yancey, is a uniquely Christian approach to racial reconciliation. George Yancey's book puts forth a new, Christian, model of racial reconciliation called mutual responsibility. Before he gives his own model of racial reconciliation, Yancey first gives and overview of different understandings of racism, followed by overviews and analysis of the four leading secular models of racial reconciliation, including the Christian adaptation of those models. He then gives his model, mutual responsibility in the second half of the book.Americans typically understand racism in either an individualist or structuralist way. Individual racism makes racism about the individual persons beliefs and actions. Social structures and factors aren't racist, only people, as moral agents, can be racist. Structural racism understands racism as something embedded in the laws, systems, and structures of the country. Structural racism holds that an individual may not be individually racist, but still benefit from racist systems. Likewise, a minority may not experience individual racism against them, but the structure of society is set up in such a way that their race is held against them. Despite some ways an individualist definition of racism can be helpful, e.g., forcing people to be accountable for their own actions, Yancey finds it ultimately insufficient to explain reality.These two understandings of racism will lead to different models of racial reconciliation. The first two, colorblindness and anglo-conformity, both flow from an individualist understanding of racism. The second two, multiculturalism and white responsibility, flow from the structuralist understanding of racism. Yancey gives each of these models a chapter and describes the model, depicts the strengths and weaknesses, and then follows up with a look at the Christian adaptation of each model.Yancey shows his skills as a sociologist in these four chapters. Each of them is balanced and fair, and he goes to pains to point out strengths in every model, even those who would seem to be strongly opposed to. This kind of humility and desire for truth is present throughout the book, and is refreshing and encouraging. Instead of caricaturing proponents of the models he disagrees with, he attempts to understand them and take what is good from them and reject what is false. If only more books, Christian or non-Christian, took this kind of approach!I won't give an overview of the four models, though I think anyone seriously interested in the topic should read this book for themselves, as his overviews are short and clear enough that my summary feels deficient and unnecessary. What I do think is the highlight of these four chapters is his criticisms of each of the four models. He shows how each of them is incomplete, and have deficiencies. These criticisms are important, especially as I have read several books which, despite nuances, fall pretty easily into these categories and still have the same deficiencies. The work of Soong-Chan Rah (Next Evangelicalism, Prophetic Lament), for example, despite his needed message, falls clearly into the category of multiculturalism, and his work has the pitfalls of that model. He lacks any real criticism of the immigrant church and would elevate minority voices above white voices. A secular example of multiculturalism would be Ibram X Kendi's Stamped From the Beginning. This book was a fascinating and well-written history, but his ultimate solution would has no way to rise above relativism. Absolute norms and ways to judge a community from outside do not exist for Kendi. These books are examples showing how well Yancey's categories and criticisms still work.After looking at the secular models, and their strengths and weaknesses, Yancey gives us his own model, mutual responsibility. This model puts forth the idea that racial reconciliation is the work of all races, and all have their own responsibility. The biggest problems with the secular models is that they are all incomplete, they all have a poor grasp of sin, and they have no role for forgiveness.The flaw with all of the secular models is that they all have an inadequate understanding of sin. The colorblind and anglo-conformity models are convenient for white people as they absolve them from responsibility. If we realize that we are corrupted by sin and naturally drawn to what is best for ourselves, we will not be surprised that these two categories are favored by whites. Nor should we be surprised that minorities are in favor of the multiculturalism and white responsibility model. It is convenient for minorities to be able to blame the majority culture for all of their problems and not to have to examine how their own failures and sin may have contributed to the problems. Our sinful nature naturally makes us want to choose what is best for us, and our model of racial reconciliation is no different.If we are to develop a uniquely Christian model of racial reconciliation, then forgiveness will be key. Christianity is unique among all religions in that it offers grace, and this is especially true of modern American Wokeness. During a British conference on comparative religions",
            "When it comes to race issues, I have to admit that for many years I\u2019ve read more books that tend to focus on personal responsibility of individuals for improving their lot in life (Sowell, Steele, D\u2019Souza, Williams, Riley, etc), thus tacitly absolving whites of responsibility for systemic racism. Over the past few years I\u2019ve deliberately sought out authors that concentrate on the historical and continuing racism that still plagues our society today (Kendi, Coates, Baldwin, Dyson, DiAngelo, etc). Both perspectives seem to have some truth on their side, but only a few books try to bridge the divide between these two viewpoints. This is one such exception. Here, Yancey evenhandedly describes each of the four primary secular models for addressing our ongoing racial problems: Colorblindness, Anglo-conformity, Multiculturalism, and White Responsiblity. He explains the advantages and deficiencies of each approach. He contends that each of these secular views fails to properly consider what Christians rightly understand about the human condition\u2014 our sin nature. Yancey attempts to bridge the divide by proposing a model of \u201cMutual Responsibility\u201d based on the Christian understanding of sin, repentance, and forgiveness. According to this model, whites need to recognize their advantages from, and complicity with, generations of systemic racism. And Blacks also have to accept some degree of personal responsibility in achieving parity. This framework requires specific, yet different responses from each group. This includes both repentance by white people, and forgiveness from Black people. Here\u2019s a couple quotes:\u201cWe cannot overcome our history by ignoring the capacity of whites and nonwhites to sin. The secular models either ignore how whites have benefited from racism or they ignore how people of color use accusations of racism to further their own self interest.\u201d\u201cEventually we develop a cycle of fear that inhibits racial healing. The fears of whites lead them to ignore racial issues. Their efforts to dismiss racial issues feeds the fear of people of color that racism will not be taken seriously. The fears of people of color deepen through the misguided efforts of majority group members. As a result, people of color begin to support leaders who foolishly play the race card but who at least uphold the importance of racial justice. Playing the race card and other actions of minority leaders increase the fears of whites that they will be labeled racist regardless of what they say or do. As whites\u2019 fears deepen, they re-double their efforts to push for the color blind philosophy. The vicious circle of dysfunctional race relations continues, with the fears of whites and the fears of people of color feeding on each other.\u201dI\u2019m not sure why I typed all this out (well, texted actually) when Matt already wrote such a great review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And here\u2019s a recent article written by the author:https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/ar...",
            "This is a really good and objective book from a black Christian sociologist, examining the different approaches the world offers for reconciliation and compares them with the truths of the Bible. Highly recommend it.",
            "SPECTACULAR!!! Simply amazing! This is the book we need right now! Go get this book and read it. Highest recommendation ",
            "This is a brilliant book that outlines the different common ideologies regarding race and gives pros/cons for each of them. Very helpful and convicting book to read no matter where you are coming from",
            "Although published 14 years ago, this book is amazingly fresh and relevant for today\u2019s racial conversation. It gives a helpful template for evaluating the many opinions and prescriptions being trumpeted today for our race problem. Yancey lays out four schools of thought (with secular and Christian versions of each), pointing out each one\u2019s strengths and inadequacies along the way. He advocates an approach of \u201cmutual responsibility\u201d that acknowledges that all humans are flawed (or sinful in Christian terms). Any approach that overlooks one\u2019s own responsibility and lays virtually all of the blame at the feet of one group is bound to fail, and will only perpetuate a vicious cycle of fear and power struggle. This is the most helpful and hopeful book I have read on race relations - and I\u2019ve read quite a few.",
            "What a lovely, balanced, thoughtful book. I really appreciate the author's heart. He certainly called me out on many of my biases. There are so many levels to the issue. I get confused when whites are all lumped together and blacks are all lumped together. Neither group is homogeneous in any way, so expecting either group to act as a body is wishful thinking. I'm not sure that corporate repentance for others' sins is biblical or corporate forgiveness for sins not done against you. I don't know that anything close to his vision is possible. However, when you just look at churches, his vision is more readily applied. I've always felt that there is no hope for general reconciliation this side of heaven and think that all we can do is try to bring healing and growth in our personal relationships and interactions. I appreciate the idea of striving for a more racially balanced local church so that it may shine as an example of God's power and goodness."

            "So many flawed, unlikeable characters!! After her mother\u2019s death, Lorraine is shocked to learn that her father wasn\u2019t a war hero and didn\u2019t die of Leukemia when she was three, he was a deserter and member of a terrorist group that blew up a building in protest of the Vietnam war. He ran off to Mexico to avoid prison for the accidental death of a security guard. (He totally felt bad about it, so it\u2019s okay. He\u2019s a good guy.) He loved Raine\u2019s mom more than anything, but he was lonely and had a couple children out of wedlock with his housekeeper - a woman just three years older than his daughter. (Grossssssss!) Raine is engaged to marry good old Gary, a nice (but somewhat controlling/patronizing) man she doesn\u2019t really want around while she\u2019s grieving, so it\u2019s no surprise that she falls in love with (and has sex with) exciting Jack. (It\u2019s because Jack is such a great guy, has nothing to do with trauma bonding.) Gary is annoyed that she hasn\u2019t called while reuniting with her father and is lonely for the two weeks or so she\u2019s been gone, so who can blame him for going to dinner with (and kissing) a an attractive coworker? Jack thinks Raine\u2019s already married, not engaged, so he pretends to be dead so she\u2019ll go home and not break up her marriage. Eighteen months later, when he comes back to her, she forgives him easily, since she doesn\u2019t have any residual issues from when her father faked his own death and abandoned her. The story wraps up with the real fantasy of the story - that you can just pick up where you left off in the third year of med school, graduate despite an unplanned pregnancy, easily finish a residency with a baby, then go on to run a busy clinic run off of charitable donations. ",
            "What an exciting read! Filled with mystery and intrigue. Several twist and turns and a very surprise ending too. I loved every minute of the book and had a very hard time putting it down. I needed to know what would happen next.",
            "Would you like some cake with that frosting? Don't get me wrong, I love happy endings. In fact, when a book like this doesn't end happy, I feel immensely disappointed. But in this case, the ending was even too sappy for me. It dragged on and on until the author had tucked away all the loose ends and wrapped the story in shiny purple paper with a big yellow bow. Even though there was a lot of violence and danger in this book, the only people who ended up dead were the bad guys. Any mistakes or reckless choices the good guys made were promptly forgiven. Ruined relationships were salvaged; estrangements were repaired; every child in this book was well behaved; and infidelity resulted in new realizations and ended up increasing everyone's happiness. Need I say more? The writing was good",
            "This was one of Debbie Macomber's finest love stories. Lorraine goes to Mexico to meet her father, she thought was dead. In the process, an artifact is hidden in her suitcase, It had been stolen and Lorraine is implicated. She escapes on a boat with Jack who pilots the boat and they encounter Carlos who seems to keep coming back to try to kill them. It's a very well written story full of suspense. Lorraine is a little too foolhardy and gets them all in trouble. She knows how to take care of herself and Jack, when he's injured. It was a perfectly entertaining audio tape that made my road trip a great one.",

In the process of tracking him down, she manages to get framed for theft and pursued by the real thief, the police and a local crime boss. Her Father's friend Jack Keller agrees to help her escape, although Lorraine's reluctant to depend on a man like him.Jack's every bit the renegade Lorraine thinks he is~~an ex-mercenary and former Deliverance Company operative. He's also the one person who can guide her to safety. But there are stormy waters ahead, including an attraction neither of them wants to feel. An attraction that's as risky as it is intense~~for both of them. The sooner he can get Lorraine home, the better!My Thoughts...This was a bit different than most books I've read by DebbieMacomber. This book was more of a romantic mystery of sorts.It really didn't draw me into the story. Some of the things that happened in the story were just to way over the top for me. Especially, all the things that supposedly happened in one day. I just couldn't buy it...Needless to say, this was not a favorite book by Debbie Macomber for me, and I usually really like her books. This book is part of my personal library, and I awarded 'Sooner' rather than 'Better' 2 stars.",

Found this was a hard to put down book. ",
            "Overall just underwhelmed by this series. The characters seemed very flat and the stories implausible. Maybe it's a mood issue, but all the women could have been accomplished and sassy but they were portrayed as too stupid to understand.

            "Moving from secure sail to the choppy, dangerous waves,When circumstances demand Loraine to be more than a little brave,There are crazy situations that make her sophisticated life lose its sheen,Here is a very different and adventurous tale from the Romance queen!About the author: Debbie Macomber is an author I have been following since a couple of years. I have developed an affinity toward light fiction in the past few months. While I have always read thrillers and suspense books, an experiment with this author set me off on the \u2018fluffy fiction\u2019 route. In a genre called \u2018Gentle Reads\u2019, famous authors like Mary Kay Andrews, Raeanne Thayne, Susan Wiggs and Robyn Carr have written about very strong protagonists who hold their own in adverse conditions. These stories do not have a \u2018thriller\u2019 element, but can be equally gripping with an entertaining story and fast-paced narrative. I like to believe that Debbie Macomber is the front runner among them with millions of followers and around 150 books under her pen. She has written many series of books like Blossom Street, Cedar Cove and Mrs. Miracle.Plot: Lorraine Dancy has a secure future waiting for her. She is engaged to a loving, smart and successful medical executive named Gary. Her impending wedding in a few months brings her joy and anticipation of a blissful life. Her only living relative, her mother Victoria Dancy, is thrilled with her decision. But the best-laid plans are sometimes thrown off track by fate. A fatal road accident kills Victoria and Lorraine is suddenly left alone in the world, reeling from the shock. She receives another blow to her fragile heart when one of her mother\u2019s belongings reveals a letter from Mexico. It states that her father Thomas Dancy, who was believed to be dead years ago, is alive and well-settled in Mexico.Lorraine\u2019s outrage and incomprehension at the sudden news of her father goad her to immediately start her search for her estranged father. She leaves behind her sophisticated and safe life in the USA to travel to the very dangerous waters of the foreign land. She just does not realize the gravity of danger until it is too late. The emotional reunion with her father goes well and good. But before she can rest up for a single night, she is accused of theft of a very rare artifact from a Mexican museum!Jack Keller, a local sailer in Mexico, is a great friend of Thomas. He would do anything for his good buddy. Little does he know, that he would be the ill-fated man to ferry Lorraine safely back to the USA before the Mexican authorities arrest her. Crude, street-smart and arrogant that he is, it doesn\u2019t take Jack much time to make Lorraine reach the limits of her patience and sanity. What follows next is a strained friendship between the beauty and the beast. While each of them despises the other, they do not have anyone else to rely on!Will the duo cross the troubled waters safely? Will they become friends at the end of the ordeal if they get out alive?My Opinion: If anyone asks me how I spent my New Year\u2019s Eve, and I answer that I was reading this book with a cup of coffee staying up most of the night, people will doubt my sanity! However, I have never been the partying kind. I will never stay up for a movie or a dance party. But hand me a book and watch me burn the midnight oil. My review writing had taken a back-seat due to many personal reasons. Hopefully, I will speed-up my writing in the new year with my reviews. While I wanted to savor this book for a few more days to acquire some insights about the characters\u2019 psyches, the title of this book itself pushed me to write the review: The Sooner The Better!",
            "The story begins at the funeral of Lorraine Danny\u2019s mother, Virginia, who died unexpectedly in an automobile accident. Weeks after the funeralLorraine meets with her mother\u2019s attorney for the reading of the will and he hands her an envelope. In the envelope is a letter that is from her father, who all these years she has believed is dead but now comes to find out is alive and living all this time in Mexico. So she decides to go to Mexico to get some answers. Her fianc\u00e9, Gary Franklin doesn\u2019t think she should go, or at least not alone but he can\u2019t persuade her otherwise. So Lorraine goes to Mexico and no sooner does she get there and she meets up with a man, Jason Applebee, who helps her get to her father\u2019s village. The minute she arrives to her father\u2019s house, she is accused of the theft of an artifact. So her father calls on the aid of a dear friend, Jack Keller to help him get his daughter out of the country and back to the United States - undetected! Read on to discover the wild and crazy adventures of Jack and Lorraine.......",
            "Quite a difference to the novels I have come to expect from Macomber. But I did find a note in the beginning that explained that the author wrote this book in the early 1990's for Harlequin. She chose to release it now under a different name from the first release. She also stated that this is a departure from her norm with a great deal of suspense and more violence than what we normally see in her books. In the THE SOONER THE BETTER her female character Raine mentions her favorite movies as Romancing the Stone and The African Queen. I think this book is a clever mixture of both and very enjoyable. I know I could not put this down. ",
            "This is the 3rd novel of a trilogy about the men that were part of an elite team of men that formed Deliverance Company. Although the majority of novels in a series by Debbie Macomber can be read as a stand-alone, I wouldn't recommend reading this novel without having read the previous two (2) books. Only then can you truly enjoy the entirety of Jack Keller's story. The Deliverance Company trilogy is not Debbie Macomber's standard fare. I liked the author's venture into adventure/suspense and am especially appreciative that she published the trilogy without use of a pseudonym. Personally",
            "This story was about Lorraine Dancy and her path to love. When Lorraine's mother passed away, she found out that her dead father was really alive and living in Mexico. She left her soon to be husband and traveled to Mexico to find her father. She made some terrible choices while in Mexico and had to leave in a hurry. Her father put her on a boat with Jack Keller, a renegade that Lorraine has a instant dislike for. But he does help her escape. One thing leads to another and I'll just say the ending is just as it should be. A pretty good read!\u00a0",
            "This book proves that Mrs. Macomber has versatility as a writer. I did not care for the language and sexuality in the book, but I loved the fast-paced action that kept me turning the page. It felt along a different vein than the previous books I've read of hers and felt like she was really having fun with this one. Her descriptions pulled me into the atmosphere and made it and the characters come alive for me. Thieves, drug dealers, murder, and the quintessential pride and prejudice love story set this book apart from the others. This is one that I will add to my Read Again list. ",
            "The author says that she wanted to write something that was a cross of Romancing the Stone and The African Queen. She accomplished that with this tale -- a departure from the type of books she usually writes. This was a wild ride of an adventure in the Gulf of Mexico.This is the third book in a series, and it definitely stands alone. (I haven't read either of the two previous tales and didn't feel lost or confused at all). Characters from the prior two books don't show up in this one until the very end, and except for a recuperation location, they really aren't needed.",
            "Two humorous love stories.Yours and Mine by Debbie Macomber is about two best friends who try everything they can to get their divorced parents together so they can be one big family.The Bachelor Doctor's Bride by Caro Carson is about a delightful young woman who tries to make everyone happy except herself."

            "Paraphrasing Whitehead, I would say that the safest general characterisation of the science-fiction tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to H. G. Wells. Indeed, The War of the Worlds is probably the most influential novel of the whole science fiction genre, as well as a significant part of the horror category. I remember reading this short novel as a child and being viscerally engrossed and terrified. Rereading it now made me aware of a few more things. First, I realised how this book sums up and, in a way, accomplishes some of the things H. G. Wells had experimented with before. To name a few: the Darwinian conflict between two similar species (The Time Machine), the fascination for freakish life forms (The Island of Dr Moreau), the chase around working-class London and its surrounding area (The Invisible Man).It is possible that H. G. Wells\u2019s remarkable book was perceived, at the close of the 19th century, as just a fin de si\u00e8cle catastrophic story \u2014 similar to, say, Mad Max or Terminator at the end of the 20th. In hindsight, The War of the Worlds is much more than that. It is indeed the kernel and the seed of all the later tales of extraterrestrial invasion and tropes of apocalyptic destruction, from H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s The Colour Out of Space to Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s Childhood's End, Robert Heinlein\u2019s The Puppet Masters, Ray Bradbury\u2019s The Martian Chronicles, Arkady Strugatsky\u2019s Roadside Picnic, Michael Faber\u2019s Under the Skin, Ted Chiang\u2019s Story of Your Life, or Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Annihilation\u2026 Not to mention films and TV: Alien, Independence Day, and so many more that I forget as I write this short note.What strikes me the most is that Wells depicts humanity in the shoes of the invaded party and pictures the invaders as an alien race of bloodthirsty molluscs \u2014 which, in itself, sounds like a veiled but stark criticism of Western imperialism and sense of superiority. But, as it turns out, Wells\u2019s prophetic vision was not so much that of a War of the Worlds with extraterrestrial invaders, but precisely a vision of the World War between fellow humans, that would break out some twenty years later, with a technological arsenal not unlike that of the Martians (cf. mechanised artillery, chemical warfare, surgical strikes). Later still, when the Second World War began, and the Nazis were about to invade the whole of Europe, Orson Welles remembered this old tale about a Martian invasion. He turned it into an incredibly relevant radio sensation. The masses of refugees, described by H. G. Wells, fleeing the war in a disorderly and life-threatening manner is a sight anyone may witness even today, despite all the concrete walls or steel fences that are supposed to stop them.In short, this is an unavoidable masterpiece. The only reproach I could make is regarding the ending. The deadly flu epidemic the Martians eventually suffer from feels a bit like a disappointing Deus ex Machina. As a side note: historically, things unfolded the other way around when Spanish Conquistadors landed on the shores of the New World. They didn\u2019t win against the Aztec and Inca Empires so much because of the superiority of their weapons, religion or culture, but because they were bringing the smallpox virus along with them \u2014 the first major and unwitting case of biological warfare.Edit: Wells\u2019s novel has been brought to the screen a significant number of times, one of the most recent ones being Steven Spielberg\u2019s adaptation (2005) with Tom Cruise. The film takes a few liberties with the book, setting the story in present-day Connecticut. However, one very clever unfaithfulness is that the aliens do not come from Mars but from underground (a nod to The Time Machine, no doubt). Spielberg isn\u2019t new to the alien-first-contact genre. But this is an outright nightmarish and nail-biting take on what had once been a benevolent musical spaceship or a heart-warming horticultural E.T. longing for home \u2014 in this film, aliens also play the trombone and are versed in landscaping. Still, they spray their gardens with human blood. Spielberg\u2019s War of the Worlds comes after the intense and graphic scenes of the Omaha Beach assault in Saving Private Ryan and is roughly in the same vein. Some scenes, like the innumerable bodies, suddenly floating down a glistening river, or the empty cloths raining from a blazing sky, are strangely beautiful and horrifying. In the midst of the gruesome devastation, Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Dakota Fanning are exceptional, playing the parts of regular people, suddenly overwhelmed with PTSD and facing the brutal ending of all things.",
            "The War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells, Arthur C. ClarkeYet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  \u2014\u2009H. G. Wells (1898), The War of the Worlds.The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells, first serialized in 1897. The War of the Worlds was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. The plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears, and prejudices. Wells said that the plot arose from a discussion with his brother Frank, about the catastrophic impact of the British, on indigenous Tasmanians. What would happen, he wondered, if Martians did to Britain what the British had done to the Tasmanians? The Tasmanians however lacked the lethal pathogens to defeat their invaders. ...\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0631

            "\u201cNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man\u2019s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter\u2026\u201d-\tH.G. Wells, The War of the Worlds Many Halloweens have come and gone since I first purchased H.G. Wells\u2019s The War of the Worlds, intending it to be part of my seasonal reading. There it sat, with many other good literary intentions. With this book in particular, I never felt any urgency. That\u2019s a function of how many derivative versions I\u2019ve consumed. I\u2019ve seen the movies, the television adaptations, and the parodies on The Simpsons. I\u2019ve also listened to a recording of Orson Welles\u2019s infamous 1938 radio broadcast. In short, I felt a nagging duty to read it, but nothing more. Having finally finished The War of the Worlds, I discovered that in some ways, the experience was superfluous. This is a short novel, coming in at around 200 pages, and it doesn\u2019t have much in the way of plot. It is quite episodic, and the various filmed versions of this tale have ably captured the major beats. In other words, there wasn\u2019t much left to surprise me, at least in terms of how it all unfolds. What did surprise me was its execution. For all the meanings heaped upon Wells\u2019s slim book, it is first and foremost brutally entertaining. This has the gloss \u2013 and sentence structure \u2013 of a classic. But at its heart, it\u2019s really just a pulpy clash between aliens and humans.*** A summary of The War of the Worlds is probably unnecessary. Suffice to say, at the end of the nineteenth century, cylinders from Mars begin burying themselves in the soil of Great Britain. From these cylinders emerge big-brained Martians, who immediately begin building war machines, which are then turned loose upon poor England. The story is told in the first-person by an unnamed narrator. We never learn too much about him \u2013 characterizations are not a strong point here \u2013 except that he is a philosopher, and that he is married. Most of The War of the Worlds consists of the narrator\u2019s own experiences as he tries to get back to his wife. Somewhat awkwardly, however, Wells also has his narrator spend time relating his brother\u2019s travails, even though he wasn\u2019t present for them. (There are some truly great scenes involving the brother, yet I found this second storyline a bit of an authorial cheat). With our narrator as a guide, the reader is taken on a tour of a section of blasted-out Great Britain that really sets the bar for all the postapocalyptic fiction to follow. Showing an absurdly keen appreciation for local geography, Wells has his narrator travel from Woking to Weybridge, Weybridge to Halliford, Halliford to Putney, Putney to London, and so on and so forth. Along the way he witnesses battles between massed artillery and alien tripods; scrounges for food; gets trapped in a house with a raving curate (perhaps the most gripping set piece); and exchanges philosophical musings with an artilleryman who has lost his unit (and possibly a few marbles). Wells\u2019s descriptions \u2013 as has been widely noted elsewhere \u2013 eerily prefigure the mechanistic slaughters to come in both the First and Second World Wars. There is poison gas and shattered cities. There are mass exoduses of terrified civilian populations, with rioting and looting in the streets. Though this is not graphic in the modern sense, Wells writes with a certain unsparing ruthlessness. In one memorable scene, a British ironclad engages in a suicidal delaying action in the River Thames. Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she was already among the Martians\u2026They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven through the iron of the ship\u2019s side like a white-hot iron rod through paper\u2026The evocation of total warfare and its aftermath is impressive, and Wells seems to take a bit of pleasure in fictionally destroying his real-life neighborhood. ***Far more than most novels featuring aliens and Heat-Rays, The War of the Worlds requires close attention. This was published in 1898, and it shows. Wells employs a rather ornate, formal style, with long, compound sentences that often try to do too much. Occasionally, I had to read a page twice to understand what was actually happening (it can be especially hard to keep track of the unnamed characters). Despite its brevity, this took me longer to finish than expected. Still, there are certain sequences that have the taut pacing and tension of a thriller. Furthermore, while Wells can occasionally be a bit wordy, he uses those words to good effect, creating lasting images. *** The War of the Worlds is one of those titles that is ripe for projection. Because it feels prophetic, there are many interpretations. The most obvious, of course, is that it is a critique of colonialism. After all, it features the world\u2019s great imperial power being forcefully subjugated by a foreign invader. Wells pointedly suggests this himself in the text, referring to the Tasmanian people of Australia being \u201cswept out of existence,\u201d and then asking whether humans were \u201csuch apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\u201d This is all well and good, but it is worth mentioning that viewed from the twenty-first century, Wells has more than a bit of baggage. He was enamored of a certain construction of \u201cnatural selection\u201d wherein all the \u201clesser\u201d races would eventually disappear, a prospect he did not exactly mourn. Wells was also known as an anti-Semite, and some of that bleeds into these pages, especially in his description of an \u201ceagle-faced man\u201d who is run over by a fleeing cab while trying to pick up gold sovereigns that have spilled on the ground. For the most part, though, The War of the Worlds seems free of whatever reprehensible notions Wells carried. While there is definitely some Darwinian concepts interwoven into the narrative, the \u201cnatural selection\u201d angle is played out vis-\u00e0-vis the conflict between humans and extra-terrestrials.*** Science fiction has always been a marvelous vehicle for addressing real social concerns through entertainment. The War of the Worlds is no exception. As noted above, it can be seen as a criticism of imperialism, or of technology, or of any number of other things. Wells has built a foundation that can support many different structures. Steven Spielberg, for example, used Wells\u2019s setup to create what is perhaps the best film to deal with America\u2019s post-9/11 anxiety and dread. If you want to think deeply about it, you can. Based on the introduction to the edition I read, many have. Just as importantly, you can choose to simply enjoy it \u2013 as I did \u2013 as the relatively lowbrow adventures of a man trying his best not to get blown up, while everything around him is spectacularly obliterated.",

Ah, but I must not spoil the book even though I imagine most people reading this review (all three of them) already know how it ends. Which brings me to my next point, if you know the story of The War of The Worlds quite well already but have not actually read the book I urge you to read it, especially if you are a science fiction fan. I don't think there are many books in the pantheon of sci-fi as important as this one. This is the book that launched the alien invasion sci-fi trope and even manages to remain one of the best examples of it.H.G. Wells was literally* light years ahead of his time, the mind boggles to think what he was able to conceive in the 19th century; alien invasion, time travel, genetic engineering, all these when TV sets are still decades in the future. If historical importance is not much of an inducement for you and you are just looking for a thumping good read Mr. Wells is also at your service here. The War of The Worlds is often thrilling, skillfully structured and narrated with some unexpected moments of philosophising and surreal dialogue. I generally find that Wells wrote much better prose than most of today\u2019s SF authors do.He even included some element of hard sf into his novels, here is an example from this book:\u201cIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light.\u201dYes, you may already have a fairly good idea of The War of The Worlds\u2019 beginning middle and end without ever reading the book but you would miss Wells\u2019 marvelously immersive and visual storytelling and the subtexts embedded in the original texts. The scene of naval battle between the military\u2019s ironclads and the Martian tripods is vividly depicted and should please fans of military sf and general badassery. The slightly surreal chapter involving the artilleryman is a particularly interesting depiction of people who always seem to be brimming with ideas, plans and suggestions but never actually do anything.The story of The War of The Worlds is so potent that Orson Welles\u2019 1938 War of the Worlds 1938 radio broadcast \u201cbecame famous for causing mass panic, although the extent of this panic is debated\u201d. Still, even moderate panic is an amazing achievement for a radio drama.This book has of course been adapted into movies several times. Unfortunately a straight adaptation complete with the Victorian setting does not seem to have been made. The most recent adaptation being the 2005 Spielberg directed movie with Tom Cruise being the usual Cruisian hero, dodging Martian heat rays like nobody's business.For this reread I went with the free Librivox audiobook version, very well read by Rebecca Dittman.I hope to eventually read all of Wells\u2019 sci-fi and perhaps his more mainstream books also. Anyway, never dismiss H.G. Wells' sci-fi as old hat because he invented the hat and it is still superior to most of today's headgear.* I have a bee in my bonnet about today's frequent (and incorrect) overuse of literally.A quick note about the ending:The ending is the mother of all Deus Ex Machina",
            "This was not anything like the Tom Cruise movie so be warned. If you\u2019re expecting an action story about a divorced union container crane operator with a 10 year old daughter you ain\u2019t gonna find it here. They changed like 99% of everything around. As far as I could see there are only two things which are the same, one is that the Martians attack Earth in these COOL THREE LEGGED METAL 70 FOOT HIGH HEAT RAY KICK ASS DEATH MACHINES and two is that they die in the same way which I won\u2019t say here because that would be a giant spoiler but really it\u2019s a bit feeble but I guess could happen because they came from Mars which don\u2019t have bacteria. I don\u2019t do biology so I don\u2019t know if a whole PLANET can not have bacteria. Seems like also they couldn\u2019t have had YOGHURT as well, but HG Wells does not make this clear. Nor Stephen Spielberg either. Now this book version I think is not the book of the movie, I think it came first so that may explain why the movie is better, because really this book is lame. Yes more realistic because like the main guy is no Tom Cruise, but less action. What happens is that the Martians land and like fry everyone up with the DEATH HEAT RAY and send out the BLACK SMOKE to finish off anyone left alive and the main guy hops around and hides and eats really gross stuff and just sees stuff. As for instance he sees the army get a lucky shot in and kill the one single Martian but then like his buddies just wipe out the whole British army. Boom, heatray zzzzz \u2013 GONE! Oh yeah the book is set in England which I thought was strange. Why not America like the movie? Anyway just when the guy has realized that from now on we\u2019re just going to be MARTIAN FRENCH FRIES and kept in cages (when not heatrayed) then the Martians just like shrivel up and die. End of. So, in my opinion, I say watch the movie. Or you could go for the prog rock version, lol. Oh I guess I did give away the end. Okay, SPOILER \u2013 sorry. But everybody knows this story. It\u2019s like saying oh in the end Dracula dies with a steak in his arse. It\u2019s a known fact.",

            "This classic 1898 science fiction novel has teeth to it, and it\u2019s not just the Martians. The War of the Worlds is a lot more thoughtfully written than I had remembered. In between deadly heat rays, huge tripod machines striding around the country killing everything in their path, and bloodthirsty Martians trying to take over Earth (starting with Great Britain), there's also critique of colonialism, religious hypocrisy, and even how humans treat animals. The ways in which people react in a crisis is given just as much attention as the Martians' actions.I read this when I was a teenager, but for whatever reason I didn\u2019t get much out of it at the time. But I let myself get roped into a GR group read of it, partly because it's so short. And also because my literary diet needs more classics. And you know? I'm glad I did.Upping my rating from 3 stars to 4.5 on reread, partly in recognition of how advanced this book was for its time in some of its concepts, and the influence it's had on the SF genre.Group read with the Non-Crunchy Classics Pantaloonless crew.",
            "You would think that as Man grows in intelligence he would likewise grow in morality. But you would be wrong. Or at least, that is what history teaches us. About a hundred years before Harvard professor Robert Coles wrote his now famous article \u201cThe Disparity Between Intellect and Character,\u201d H.G. Wells made much the same observation.At the end of The War of the Worlds, the unnamed narrator returns to his house and sees the paper he had been working on before the war began. \u201cIt was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilizing process\u201d (194). There\u2019s one for the wastepaper basket! As with much science fiction, the aliens in The War of the Worlds reveal more about us than about them.Throughout the book, Wells compares Man with the lower animals. And it becomes increasingly uncomfortable. At the start, we are microbes under the Martians\u2019 microscope. We might be able to pass over the metaphor without much thought if only he didn\u2019t go on to compare us to monkeys, lemurs, dodo birds, bison, ants, frogs, rabbits, bees, wasps, and rats ~ animals we exploit or exterminate without compassion. The narrator doesn\u2019t fail to make the connection between the Martians\u2019 treatment of humans and our treatment of animals. When he discovers that the Martians regard human beings as food, he is able to shift his perspective and see the human diet from the point of view of an animal that is typically regarded as food: \u201cI think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit\u201d (139).Moreover, it is not only animals that we destroy. Other humans are also fair game. \u201cAnd before we judge of them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\u201d (5).If only moral growth went hand-in-hand with intellectual growth! But apparently evolution doesn\u2019t work that way. So a look at the Martians is a look into a mirror. It is also a look into our own future. And it is a future difficult to look upon. The Martians are ugly. And not just on the outside. Evolution has turned them into little more than heads. Thanks to natural selection, their bodies function with marvelous efficiency. They need not eat, sleep, or engage in sexual intercourse. They communicate by telepathy. Through Darwinian adaptation, they lost what they did not need to survive and developed what they did need. And what they needed was intellect, not character. Heads, not hearts. Is this where our species is headed? Wells was an advocate of Darwinism and if the Martians represent the future of Man, then The War of the Worlds must be read as a cautionary tale. The Epilogue supports this interpretation:\u201cIf the Martians can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils. Should we conquer?\u201d (198-199).Should we conquer? If we don\u2019t want to become blood-sucking heads without hearts we had better not! On the contrary, we had better learn compassion for those over whom our superior intelligence gives us power. \u201cSurely, if we have learnt nothing else, this war has taught us pity \u2014pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion\u201d (166).",
            "The War of the Worlds belongs to the league of immortal books.Tribal wars, civil wars, colonial wars\u2026 H.G. Wells managed to raise a phenomenon of war to the higher interplanetary level.The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noises \u2013 the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint, and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.Panic and terror\u2026 It is useless to fight back\u2026 The only way to escape is to flee and hide\u2026 And the horrendous invaders \u2013 gigantic extraterrestrial bedbugs \u2013 know no mercy.Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a workman\u2019s basket hangs over his shoulder.Although the victory may come from an unexpected quarter but all the invasions sooner or later are doomed.",

In all seriousness this is a re-read because I want to go on to Stephen Baxter\u2019s The Massacre of Mankind, which is part of one of this years numerous challenges (why do I do this to myself ?)Anyway GR says this is my 2nd read of this classic book (hah, what does GR know), whereas in fact it is probably my 5th or maybe 6th. To me it is certainly 4.5 stars and is enjoyable for so many reasons. The book itself is well written, as per usual from HG, it is not just a science fiction book but an in depth look or even examination of human nature and lastly I spent my childhood growing up and walking around the villages and countryside where the cylinders landed, so expected to see a Martian at any moment.

I had to watch it each and every time it played on television. The same running dialogue would go on inside my head: \u201cCowardly dudes, don\u2019t wave that white flag, they\u2019re Martians, they\u2019re probably color blind or something. Oops",
            "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as our own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.Hmmmmm, how fucking amazing is this? Actually, the whole first chapter of this book, titled, THE EVE OF WAR is pretty amazing. Very enjoyable. The book loses something when it adopts our MC telling us about his experiences during the invasion",

The dispassionate and overly formal style of writing/reporting constantly dragged me back to a long ago time and place almost as foreign as Mars itself. His speculative philosophy",
            "Wells invented cliches for a Hollywood blockbuster before Hollywood had any. He was truly a visionary: predicted all possible plot twist for the post-apocalyptic stories. Except one - in his book aliens attacked Britain not the USA.",
            "While it may seen inhumane to all the stockbrokers and their dependants, there is some vicarious pleasure to be had in the destruction of Surrey commuter towns by the Martians. The fear, confusion and rapid break down of late Victorian life following on from the initial attack is striking. The War of the Worlds is one of those science-fiction books that are full of contemporary fears - it is a pre World War One invasion fantasy like The Riddle of the Sands but with the German army transformed into the Martians. Zeppelins and U-Boats transformed into striding tripods and heat rays.The sun may not have set on the British Empire but the fear of destruction lurks everywhere. For Childers and Wells the threat is external and military rather than internal and social. Eventual victory doesn't represent change - just the continuity of militarism. As a vision of Imperial Britain's place in the world it is incredibly narrow and fearful - the application of fight or flight as the only choices in international relations, but as events a few years later would show this was a way of seeing the world that was widespread across Europe.An interesting feature, particularly maybe from the perspective of empire, is that the aliens are not defeated they self-destruct in an accelerated version of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Martian Empire - if you are going to keep your empire, mere technological superiority is not enough, one needs inner vigilance too otherwise you'll dive into decadence and start mixing your bodily fluids with sub-Martians, then before you know it - you are bird food. For once then, eugenics turns out to save us all.",
            "Absolute classic. At the end of the 19th century earth (Britain to be precise) is invaded by the Martians. They come in kind of cylinders and devastate the surroundings of London. The population of London flees. There is absolute chaos. Can those invaders be stopped? A compelling novel on humanity feeling too safe on their planet. We can't let our guards down. As we can see now the invaders may not come from outer space but a virus may even be deadlier than extraterrestrials. Great descriptions",
            "As I was reading this, two thoughts struck me. The first was that this book was less about Martians than it was about how humanity views itself as the Kings of the Earth. Mankind has always had this annoying tendency to think that whatever serves us is good and right",
            "This is supposed to reflect the anxieties of Victorian England about being invaded,and even when the attack is finished,the author cautions that another invasion is possible.There is an irony here.It was England itself which had occupied so much of the globe,and it is mankind that has managed to reach Mars.And had it encountered any Martians there,wars would have been waged on Mars,just as they always have been on earth.It is not a pleasant book to read.It is all about disaster. Possibly the first major book about alien invasion of the earth,something I've grown tired of,given Hollywood's obsession with it.Wells describes the chaos after the invasion well,as social order is destroyed.And guess what defeats the Martians,earth's pathogens just the way they are attacking humanity now.The Martians don't need to sleep,they can be active all the time,they don't need the distraction of sex to procreate,they live on the blood of living creatures and they are all intelligence.Sounds pretty efficient.A novel idea for its time,but I can't say it fully held my attention.Would have liked it to be shorter.2.5 stars",
            "Probably everyone knows the basic plot, so there is no need to elaborate -- Martians come, they kick humanity's collective ass. The story is narrated by an average (if well-educated) guy who happens to see the arrival and survive, and is scrambling around trying to find food without getting seen in the process. Contra the movies, he is not heroic or important to the outcome of the invasion, which I thought an intriguing authorial choice.A couple aspects that were interesting to me:--The narrator several times mentions that how humans are feeling as the Martians prey upon them must be similar to the helplessness and fear that animals feel when we hunt and kill them. The Martians are abhorrent to us because they are killing us, and also look hideous to us, but that's perspective. From their point of view they are doing nothing wrong. I wonder if their have been any reception studies done on how Wells' contemporaries felt about this position?--I haven't heard this mentioned, but WoW is in fact an alternate-history novel, or set in a similar parallel universe, because it is mentioned in passing that this invasion occurred in the recent past and now we have all sorts of new technology thanks to remainders of Martian vehicles, and also there is greater global cooperation. Has anyone ever written a follow-up novel in this setting? It seems like such an obvious idea (especially with the end point that the Martians could attack again and Earth needs to prepare) that I cannot believe no author has done it, but I haven't encountered such a book.p.s. Why is the cover bright pink? Doesn't really suit the tone of the book, and I doubt that was colored by Gorey."

            "Children of the Thunder is a science fiction novel by John Brunner.John Brunner has written a really wonderful book 'THE SHEEP LOOK UP' that I should probably re-read. This book came close but not quite to the despondency that Earth is supposed to face in the present/near future.There is developing computers in this book and witch scares about AIDS making this a little dated, but when the whole think is rolled together then it makes for one loud polluted toxic page fart. Kids. They do the darnedest things! This kid, Dave, is a computer whiz who makes designer drugs that often kill people as a byway. Oh well. He is the product of an artificially inseminated mother and seems to have some kind of charm about him. He looks at you and touches you and you think it's a good idea to just drop down and suck him off, forget about the crap he's pulled. What a card!!Bad seeds are all over the place. These kids are up to no good committing theft, vandalism, sex ring rackets and murder. It's ok, good kids right....they get away with it! On top of this book is some news blurbs popping up about a General Thrower who is trying to get England into ship shape with bringing back the h bomb and getting rid of anyone not of white euro stock. He is putting the polluted pox cherry on the top of the toxic world trash heap. One guy is just involved with all this as a science editor, he and his acquaintance are trying to figure out why these kids, there's a few out there, don't fit into the normal pattern of bad kid with bad situations. They excel in the bad situations and no one seems to do anything about it. What's going to happen since no one can get certain foods to take anymore without a virus beating it to extinction. Animals are getting cancer very easily. Chain reactions of the food chain dying out. Everything will be unaffordable? Trash food is cheap.I don't like the way Brunner sometimes glosses over the characters and plot developments in one or two sentence bursts. He just drops facts and tidbits in a sentence without flesh sometimes. This book is no exception for me. I find myself rereading a sentence, 'ok so this kid here just blew this rocket up and it was to see a program on his computer worked. Yep ok, got it, couple sentences, big boom. Although by the end of the book I was going bananas to get to the climax, regardless, there was just enough meat anyway to keep the bones in my mouth and swallowing the final bone splinter gagged me, but in a way that I was definitely grinning gristle happy teeth.Originally posted this review on sfbook.com",
            "Another hugely compelling dystopian novel by John Brunner who I was introduced to via the very impressive The Sheep Look Up. This story has a similar background of greedy companies and xenophobic governments destroying the world one scandal and environmental disaster at a time, presented in short news clips. However, the central plot is focused on a journalist and a researcher trying to verify stories of children with mysterious powers in an increasingly totalitarian and racist Britain.I found this as hard to put down as The Sheep Look Up, but the payoff was not as satisfying to me. It's rather open-ended as with The Sheep Look Up, but the paths of the main characters are more prescribed. A sort of twist at the end is highly obvious in retrospect, but also didn't feel particularly interesting to me, or very relevant to the themes the story had been examining. Ultimately I feel like there was a degree of conflict between the personal story Brunner wanted to tell of the main characters and the wider environmental story he wanted to tell about the world, which left both a little underserved. An enjoyable read, but I don't think it'll stick with me in the same way as The Sheep Look Up.",
            "review of John Brunner's Children of Thunder by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - December 23, 2013 This might be called Brunner's 'Demon Seed' novel, it centers around exceptionally successfully manipulative children. I'm reminded of the grim picture of children in the background of his Players at the Game of People (1980) (see my review here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... ) & of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange (1962), wch I've read, & of John Wyndham's The Midwich Cuckoos (1957) (filmed as Village of the Damned), wch I probably haven't read but wch I might've experienced in movie form. As is typical of so many of my reviews of Brunner novels, I find it difficult to write about w/o spoiling the plot for interested readers. However, it's 'safe' to quote from the 1st page's promotional excerpt: Crystal Knight was thirteen",
            "Recently found this in a charity shop, it's not one of Brunner's best but I kept reading because of his remarkable prescience on the political climate of today. OK he didn't have the same prescience on technology, no smart phones, dial up modems etc. But! The background to this story set in the UK in the 1990's is so relevant to today, crops blighted with pesticides, killing bees, an extreme Right Wing government that only allows patriotic news and controls the BBC output. People attacking anyone of a different colour",
            "In many ways typical dystopic Brunner. However, I was surprised (and saddened) at how accurate his description of England actually was, especially given the trends of the last few months as the UK approaches Brexit. Good story, though I must confess I guesses the final plot turn about half way through the book. Still an enjoyable read even if the plot holes were fairly large. Interesting in that I was immediately reminded of Marvel's Jessica Jones first series, though this obviously predates the tv series by decades. I particularly liked the degeneration of society as depicted by the asides as the book developed.",
            "It's quite slow to build and the formatting often left me confused about the perspective changes. But it's a fascinating look at the world of today written 30 years ago. It's also quite disturbing in places, and because of the repeated perspective switches and a fairly jumble voice, it's sometimes hard to separate the actions and beliefs of the characters from the overall voice of the book.",
            "This is really very insightful; amazing really, how many things Brunner got right. Another one where it should be required reading, just so people can make thoughtful choices. What I didn't find was characters to like, and a pretty grim world.",
            "Another one that stuck in my head without title attached. I wish it hadn't."

        "description": "Along with Sandra Cisneros and Julia Alvarez, Esmeralda Santiago has emerged as one of today's preeminent Latina authors. Legions of fans have waited five long years for the next chapter of the story begun in her memoirs When I Was Puerto Rican and Almost a Woman . And now the wait is over. In The Turkish Lover, Esmeralda finally breaks out of a monumental struggle with her powerful mother-only to come under the thrall of \"the Turk\" and discover that romantic passion, too, can become a prison. Esmeralda's journey of self-liberation and self-discovery is a daring one, candidly and zestfully recounted, and leads, most surprisingly, to her graduation from Harvard. (Her view of that venerable institution is an eye opener, told as only a brilliant writer totally outside the mold can tell it.) The expansive humanity, earthy humor, and psychological courage that made Esmeralda's first two books so successful are on full display again in The Turkish Lover , which will both reward the author's faithful readership and extend it. Hers is a fresh, exciting, and necessary voice. A Merloyd Lawrence Book",

            "ISBN 0738208205 - I often wondered, as I read this book, whether it was among the most self-serving blather I'd read in ages or one of the best books I'd read in years. Really, what's more self-serving than immortalizing your own existence in a book? And how much better when that book makes a former lover, who treated you poorly, look like a fool - repeatedly? In the end, though, the answer is - one of the best books I've read in years! If the periodic Spanish phrase intimidates the English-reading-only, don't let that stop you - almost every phrase is smoothly translated in the text.Esmeralda Santiago, oldest of eleven children, runs away from home. At age 21, runs away sounds strange",
            "Sinopsis:Esta memoria es la apasionante historia de una peligrosa y ex\u00f3tica relaci\u00f3n amorosa.Esmeralda Santiago se destaca entre las principales escritoras latinas de hoy. Sus fieles lectores y lectoras han esperado cinco largos a\u00f1os por el m\u00e1s reciente cap\u00edtulo de una historia que comenz\u00f3 con sus memorias Cuando era puertorrique\u00f1a y Casi una mujer.En El amante turco",
            "This is not the type of book I would pick up and I am extremely critical of memoirs. However a lady at work gave it to me to read knowing I was a traveled and learned woman. Santiago captures the essence of Puerto Rican culture and paints a vivid story of her life with her Turkish love interest. I found myself identifying with her a lot in the relationship she had with Ulvi. The idea that the love you create as a wall to protect you can easily become a prison you want to escape. It is only by trust and open heart and listening and stating your needs that the wall is not your prison or protection but becomes a stepping stone to rise above situations and expand and reach higher. And that is what was missing in the authors relationship, she didn't know what she wanted, their relationship did not have the foundation of trust needed and neither listened to the other (she expressed her opinions, he didn't care or find them interesting. He said no one could love you like I do and she could not hear that he was trying to isolate her.)This is how a memoir should be written",
            "This author is my personal favorite. Sharing the same culture, I can immediately relate and register what she's saying as feelings I've had myself. I always like to read her work in spanish but I read it in english and felt that she had really evolved to be ale to express herself JUST as powerfully in both languages. Her previous books I enjoyed in spanish because I know as a Puerto Rican spanish speaker, it would resinate with me even more so by having that flow that can be kinda butchered when translated to english. This memoir of here's is so deep and beautifully written, I could feel the intensity she felt, and the love that consumed her with her Turkish lover. It's definitely a book that I had to wait to read since I started reading her work at 15, but any mature mind (and particularly a woman) would enjoy this book. If you enjoy getting a taste of culture, reality and feel like you can relate, this book is definitely one to check out. ",

Upon lifting each flap, a certain number of bugs are revealed. Each page contains a different kind of bug, as well as one more bug than the previous page. The illustrations are colorful and creative, capturing the attention of a young audience learning to count very well. Professional Recommendation/Review #1: Marilyn Courtot (Children's Literature)\u00a0David Carter is a paper engineer who creates very clever books. This board book version of his original large format pop-up is a real delight. Kids learning to count will enjoy pulling the tabs to see the strange and colorful array of bugs that appear. Carter s imagination has run wild as he presents four fast fleas in a small box and five mellow-yellow fish bugs in a big blue box. Not only are numbers presented with a chance to count all the little critters, other concepts, such as size and color, are also part of the text. It is fun, funny, and educational, and it will hold up to many tugs by little hands.

            "Carter, David. How Many Bugs in a Box (1987 ) In this pull up, pop-up, open the flap counting book children guess how many bugs are in the box. Of course the first box holds one bug and the last box holds ten bugs but along the way children are taught other concepts such as what is the difference between a tall box or a small box, or a thin box and a square box. The bugs are imaginative and entertaining, such as the space bugs that look like rockets jettisoned into space or the fishy bugs that swim with swimmers fins. Good for tactile learning students as the nature of pop up books engages the students not only by listening to the story but engaging in the book by opening and closing flaps and pulling out pop ups. Target Audience: ages 2-5",
            "David A Carter wrote a great book using boxes full of bug to help children learn to count. The book counts one through ten giving each page a new excitement from the surprises in order to figuring out how many bugs are on each page. As you flip through the pages on the left side there is a the same wording of the question \u201chow many bugs are in the box?\u201d The twists to each of these pages are the describing words along with the question. Some of these describing words are used to describe the color, height, design, shape, and weight. On the other side of the pages are the boxes that were described on the left of the page. The author used both sides of the page to draw attention to each individual number. The illustrations in this book are key to making it fun for children to read. Each page is full of bright colors that are also used to make designs around the boxes. They will be learning without realizing they are becoming aware of the patterns of the numbers and the order they go in. When the book turns to each page the children cannot see the bug right away, forcing them to read the page before they have the luxury of opening up the box, or whichever interesting fact that will pop out at them when they go to see how many bugs are in the box. This book will have kids counting over and over again. This interactive book has very interesting features allowing the kids to open up flaps on each page along with pulling strings and counting the pop up of bugs. I strongly suggest using this book for readers that are also struggling with counting. Children will enjoy this exciting, colorful book full of surprises. ",
            "Best Pop-Up Books Ever!I've purchased almost every title in this series and have yet to be disappointed by any of them. My 8-year old son requests to read them again and again and again, and now that he's reading on his own - likes to read them to himself.Now that he's older, he is also very careful not to tear the pop-ups, but I've got to admit that there are a few titles we've bought more than once. He probably got his first pop-up book at the age of two - and although the pop-ups are quite sturdy and made for little hands to enjoy - he did manage to tear a few of them. I think this is inevitable if you want to introduce your child to pop-up books at an early age, and since the pop-up books in this series are reasonably priced - I've been more than happy to replace the ones he was a little too hands-on with!What do we like about the pop-ups?

From them I know, for instance, that wild leeks are not generally found in eastern Iowa but are found across the Mississippi in Illinois. I also appreciate how the guide in broken up into seasons so you can concentrate on the right portion of the book depending on the time of the year.However, the depth of information is rather low and sometimes the photos are not precise or thorough enough to be sure of identification. To make up for these deficits I suggest picking up Steven Brill's book on the subject to fill in additional details. The drawings and text in that book compliment this book well.",

Only one pic per plant and usually at the plant's full maturity, which is not necessarily the best time to harvest. Some of the pics are even in black and white (how does that help?!). This book is useful so long as you have at least one more book for cross reference.",
            "This guide is very useful, but it seems that much information is missing. It would be useful to have a little more information about how to process the foods.

A time when everything was so much simpler, not easier, but less distracting. I loved being transported to that time and place, just 1.5 hours from my hometown. While it is fiction, much of it was based on the life of the author. This village and upbringing was probably very similar to the life of my great grandparents. I feel lucky to have found this book and thankful to the author for sharing her story.",

The reader sees the people, especially her parents and neighbors, and the events of her small town through her eyes, and that is quite an interesting view. I actually read this book in one sitting, because it was such an absorbing read, and I was hooked by what was happening in the town. The story recalls an earlier era, when life was simpler in some ways, but nonetheless complicated by the basic human qualities that appear in people no matter what the age or time period. Definitely a good read!",
            "This fictional memoir relates the wonderful and exciting happens in the small town of Troy, Illinois as related by 11-year-old Helene Merriam Bradford. There are thrilling events like a funeral where the Bradfords meet Mr. Fenton, a Springfied lawyer who befriends the family; a chase after a couple who will be living in sin that culminates in a visit to a hoarfrost house; an unbirthday; a motorcar and more serious events that young Helene can't understand.

            "Told through the eyes of Helene, an 11-year-old living in small-town Illinois in 1900, it's a story of small-town America, where neighbors know everyone's business and a lemon jelly cake is metaphoric for life in general. Helene is precocious and learns about the world around her through casual adventures with her best friend. Madeline Babcock Smith's Tory, Illinois is not an idealized generation, or a glossy look at how things probably were not, but an environment as seen by an 11-year-old. Life in Tory was not perfect, and between the lines of cakes and bead necklaces are heavy implications of extramarital affairs. And 11-year-old may not be able to describe the behaviors of others enough to directly explain the relationships of the adults around her, but adult readers are able to see the signs. The story is a reminder not that turn-of-the-century small towns were a better time and place, but that serious issues did occur beneath the icing.I've meant for years to read this book. As I crossed from the young adult to adult books at the library a long time ago I remember seeing this cover constantly, but I never did check it out. The cover has been stuck in my brain for years, a simple Grandma Moses sort of image, long after the actual title slipped from my mind. How I came across the title or author now is beyond me, but once I did I made an effort to have it interlibrary loaned for me to read now. It's a quick read and enjoyable though not likely to make the list of my favorite coming-of-age stories. The cake metaphor, after all, was a little rich.",

Helene and Gracie are best friends in a small town in Illinois at the turn of the century. 1900 to be exact.This story is set in a more mellow time but still the girls learn about a serious subject. Helene, the doc's daughter and Gracie, the preacher's daughter are curious about town but they are held to higher standards due to their father's occupations.They still catch a lot of gossip and know about most everyone in town. In the summer of 1900, the first horseless carriage comes to town, and each of the girls mothers finds they have an admirer. Each of the parents handle the situation in a different way and the little girls become a little wiser that summer.First published in 1952, this small town charmer is one of the Prairie State books.

Life was simpler then, but people still had some of the same problems as we do today, including financial difficulties, health concerns, and unhappy marriages. With the story being told though the eyes of a child, we see Helene's perspective on some of the more sordid events that go on about her that she is too young to fully understand. The book is based on the author's childhood and includes many interesting tidbits about small-town life at the turn of the century, when the Civil War was in living memory and cars were still a new invention.",
            "This simple tale of small town American life at the turn of the century is told through the eyes of eleven year old Helene Bradford, a rather naive only child of the town's doctor. The story is in turns sweet, funny, and touching. Though the book depicts the past of over a century ago the themes of marriage and domesticity are surprisingly current. My one reservation is that for being such a gentle book there was an uncomfortable amount of blasphemous language used. Still it was an enjoyable read and one I'd recommend with that one caveat.",
            "Similar in some ways to O Ye Jigs and Juleps!, although with more emphasis on grown-up problems that don't always resolve easily or well. The child's voice is less believable than in Virginia Cary Hudson's book. An easy and entertaining book to read.",

We very often get hints from adults as to what is really happening behind the scenes that they are protecting their little girl from. If you want a book that is an joy to read but also has a message behind it, read this!",

            "Just like a piece of lemon jelly cake, this book, told from 11-year-old Helene\u2019s eyes, was sweet and fun to read. The setting is 1900 in a small town in Illinois. Times were more simple but human nature was much the same, providing many layers to life. There were many cute moments and many tongue-in-cheek moments as well. I loved the small town antics and being transported to this time in American history. It is a shame the author died shortly after this book was originally published in the 1950\u2019s; I\u2019m glad I was able to experience her book! "

            "Disappointing anthology, I'd not have expected one by Datlow & Windling to be this mediocre as I'd generally found the previous ones good, or at least containing a few short stories I enjoyed.This one has 22 short stories and poems with the common theme of relationships between a non-human/supernatural character and a human one. Summed up like that, it sounds like the editors were going for an anthology of Beauty and the Beast stories like what they attempted with their anthology The Beastly Bride but more paranormal than beastly. Unfortunately, they weren't at their best in picking the stories for this anthology.The full title of this anthology has this bit: Tales of Love and Seduction. Excuse me if I protest at the misleading title and the lack of sensible criteria, because most of the short stories included here are neither of love nor of seduction. In fact, there's short stories about rape by the protagonist, mother-son incest, at least two about bestiality, and at least three about prostitution (three! These authors must have a whore fetish or something), hermaphrodite sex, and so on. What a tremendous failure it is as an erotica anthology trying to be sold as loving and sexy; if honesty were to be applied, the truth would be that this is an anthology of kinky and deviant sexual practices.I felt bored by the stories that I only have three to name as those I liked best:- My lady of the hearth",

This collection of 22 short stories, some by very famous authors, goes from very sexy to creepy to thought-bending. I liked some of the stories a lot, and some of them, not so much. Not a bad way to sample these authors and see if you might like their longer works.",
            "22 stories that combine fantasy with erotica by exploring seductive, magical, unearthly lovers and romances. Datlow and Windling, especially in combination, are accomplished anthologists, but this is the closest I've come to disappointed with their work. For one, only three stories feature queer relationships (two others have them in background roles); the heteronormativity is toxic and uncreative, a particular oversight in a collection of strange love. (Compare to something like Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan's phenomenal The Ammonite Violin & Others.) At its worst, the heteronormativity is damning: the stories are magical and strange only because the attractive, desirable women have power that threatens their everyman partners. For another, the collection has an unforgivably slow start: you can skip the first seven stories and miss nothing.There's a marked improvement with the first standout story: Elizabeth E. Wein's No Human Hands to Touch",
            "While this is clearly a collection of erotic stories, it is the creativeness of the stories that garners attention in this collection. I would consider this a queer collection; even the stories between a man and a woman hold something quite out of the ordinary. Probably the most memorable story for me is Attachments by Pat Murphy"

One of the core goals of this book, from its first edition on, has been to develop a new and more widely applicable vision of applied linguistics.

            "Here is a really simple test to know how much you know about \u2018grammar\u2019. If you think there is one grammar (or even one grammar per language) and that is known as \u2018proper grammar\u2019 \u2013you basically don\u2019t know anything about grammar. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 that\u2019s a pretty blissful state of ignorance to be in and has much to recommend it. But there are lots of different ways to do \u2018grammar\u2019 and hardly any of them are \u2018proper\u2019 \u2013 transformational grammar, socio-linguistics, traditional grammar, generative linguistics, systemic-functional linguistics, critical discourse analysis\u2026 Mmm.The big division is between the Chomskyan and the various social grammars. For Chomsky grammar is innate, independent of individual languages or even language \u2018performances\u2019 and therefore the study of linguistics needs to focus on language\u2019s \u2018deep structures\u2019 as these can illuminate the genetic structures that fascinate language learning. Mostly this kind of grammar is interested in sentence level analysis of language and the transformations that can be made upon the deep structure of languages. This isn\u2019t really about what most people take \u2018grammar\u2019 to mean \u2013 split infinitives and stuff like that, but rather how the surface structures of our languages can reveal the mental processes we are born with that make our learning languages possible in the first place (hence Pinker\u2019s The Language Instinct). The other side is sociolinguistics. This says that language only exists because there is a \u2018you\u2019 as well as a \u2018me\u2019 \u2013 that is, that language is essentially a social activity and can\u2019t be understood at all outside of the social context in which it is used. Any theory with \u2018discourse\u2019 in or around its title almost definitely owes something to Foucault, just as anything with \u2018critical\u2019 in its title probably owes something to Marx, but more importantly, both fall on the \u2018social\u2019 rather than \u2018transformational\u2019 side of this debate.Right from the start Gee makes it clear that the rules of grammar are not at all what you might think they are from the millions of proper \u2018usage\u2019 books you might find in any bookshop. He talks about a man going into a \u2018bikers\u2019 bar\u2019 and how it is possible for him to use perfectly formed grammatical sentences and still be wrong. If he were to say in such a situation, \u201cPardon me, old chap, can I trouble you for a light? I was hoping to \u2018blow some blue\u2019 as I believe you have it in your local idiom\u201d, while that is a perfectly grammatical sentence, it is clearly not \u2018correct\u2019 for that situation. Whereas, \u201cOy, fart-face, give-us a light\u201d might well be, ironically enough, much suited to the social context, less likely to get you beaten up and therefore a better example of \u2018correct\u2019 grammar. Grammar, then, is always situated. A lot of this book is about working out the implications of precisely this insight.Take this article from The Guardian as a case in pointhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/20...Whereas the English often make their class distinctions quite explicit, the US likes to hide theirs and pretend they don\u2019t really exist. Here in Australia we fall much more towards the US prejudices in this case. Gee talks about Discourses \u2013 essentially a way people have of communicating with the world \u2013 and how these come in various forms. There is a lovely description of a young Black American girl telling a story in class and how this is structured in ways that make lots of sense from within the mostly oral culture she has been brought up in \u2013 with lots of parallelisms and rhyme structures \u2013 but how this way of telling stories is not correct for school room discourse types, which have very strict rules about how stories need to be structured. He compares this to something a young middle class white girl says in class and which the teacher approves of. Naturally enough, the middle class white girl labels things explicitly in her speaking, even things that are \u2018obvious\u2019 from the context. This is something her parents are likely to have encouraged in her by reading and discussing books with her from her earliest years \u2013 \u2018what\u2019s that? Yes, that\u2019s a doggie. What is the doggie doing?\u2019. But this is a discourse type that is alien to this young black girl.Often the solution presented in these circumstances is to suggest schools should teach these skills to the students that do not have them. The problem often is much harder than this, though. Most of the rules needed to engage in this discourse (or any discourse) are implicit \u2013 that is, the teachers might not even know these rules exist themselves, but like the biker who watches you take out you handkerchief from your denim jacket pocket and dust down your barstool before you sit down, he just \u2018knows\u2019 something isn\u2019t right with you. It is that line from My Last Duchess:\u201cEven had you skillIn speech--which I have not--to make your willQuite clear to such an one, and say, Just thisOr that in you disgusts me; here you miss",
            "Critical discourse, civil discourse, dominant discourse, multiple Discourses -- Gee has given me the theory and vocabulary to conceive all of these approaches to discourse as one interrelated linguistic project of analysis. And it wasn't painful at all. It's a book like this that excites me to be a scholar engaged in relevant, actionable research for social justice.",
            "Can you tell I'm catching up on grad school work? The ideas in this book are extremely interesting to me. My attention was captured in the first few chapters, especially. However, by the second half of the book, it felt a little repetitive. Maybe I'm just tired. Hard to say. What I really appreciate about Gee is that he reminds us that we teach to broaden perspectives. Should broadened perspectives not also include the idea that different forms of language, social communication, story telling, etc. help broaden our perspectives in environments such as school and the workforce? There is much to consider in this book in order to challenge education beyond fixed knowledge. ",
            "This book will always have a special place in my life. And not because it might be the best book written in the area, but because it was my official introduction to psycholinguistics. The book touches upon several subjects including the concept of discursive communities, that is, communities with specified language and communication norms. The book as the title will clue you in also argues that any discourse or discursive community is ideologically based. This is important when James Paul Gee looks at discursive differences in the classroom and how a girl's story is deemed as 'wrong' since it deviates the classroom discourse(the girl was African American and told the story in an discursive style that is common to her community). As such, the book deals strongly with discursive communities and how they affect the area of education, which is something that I believe anyone in education should pay attention to. Like I said, I have a special fondness for this book, but aside from that, I believe that its implications have a broader appeal since we all belong to discursive communities and the way in which we interact and yes judge people is based on our understanding of how they communicate and how such communication styles interacts with our own. Definitely an eye opening book as far as my education and understanding of language is concerned. ",
            "This is book presents a fascinating insight to the moral motivation for studying linguistics, specifically discourse in its social setting. Everyone speaks multiple social langauges that they use in many different situations. These langauges and word choice reveal our values and belief about the world and our society. These beliefs are typically tacit and difficult to explain. However",
            "Wow. This book took me a little while to finish, but that was because Gee gives his readers so much to think about in every chapter. I'm new to discourse theory (theories?) but Gee's ideas immediately clicked with me. A real review to follow. ",
            "Though I have reservations on some of Gee's opinions, specifically mushfaking, he presents valuable information, presented in a way that is applicable and thought provokng",
            "So. Many. Typos. I don't know if this is the right edition, to be honest, since I have the fifth edition, but there are so many mistakes that it distracts from the ideas, which are presented in a pretentious way that makes me want to roll my eyes every few seconds. Other than that, the ideas themselves are solid and interesting. ",

            " Maya Angelou recites her poem for Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration.MAYA Angelou, author of the best-selling books I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Gather Together in My Name, and the Heart of a Woman, has also written several collections of poetry, including Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water \u2019fore I Diiie. She read her poem On the Pulse of Morning at the inauguration of President William Jefferson Clinton on January 20, 1993. She also wrote 10 one-hour programmes for the television series called \u2018Blacks, Blues, Blacks\u2019, which highlight Africanisms still current in American life.  Angelou struts her stuff with her partner.However, the book under discussion here is Angelou\u2019s 1993 book Wouldn\u2019t Take Nothing for My Journey Now which is considered by many to be an inspirational book. Written in the form of short essays, this memoir muses on spirituality, people who have been important in her life, womanhood, racism, travel and other topics.  Angelou painted by Guy Stauber.In \u2018New Directions\u2019 she writes: \u2018In 1903 the late Mrs Annie Johnson of Arkansas found herself with two toddling sons, very little money, a slight ability to read and add simple numbers. To this picture add a disastrous marriage and the burdensome fact that Mrs Johnson was a Negro.\u2019 Mr William Johnson too was dissatisfied with the marriage. He told her he wanted to preach in Enid, Oklahoma but he did not tell her that he knew a minister there with whom he could study and who had a friendly, unmarried daughter. The couple parted amicably. Annie, who was sturdy and over six feet tall, decided that she would not go to work as a domestic servant and leave her \u2018precious babes\u2019 to someone else\u2019s care. In Annie\u2019s words: \u2018I looked up the road I was going and back the way I come, and since I wasn\u2019t satisfied, I decided to step off the road and cut me a new path.\u2019 Each morning Annie, armed with an iron brazier and coal, would walk three miles to a cotton mill, carrying two five-gallon pails filled with chicken pies. On reaching the venue she would cook fresh pies and sell it to the labourers for lunch. Then she would walk another five miles down the road to a lumber mill where she would sell her remaining pies. Towards evening she would walk back the eight miles to her house to take care of her babies and her home. The next day she would first walk to the saw mill to sell her pies and then to the cotton gin. She would walk a total of 16 miles everyday. Although business was slow at first, it gradually started picking up. When she was sure that the workers had become dependent on her, she built a stall between the two hives of industry and let the men come to her for their luncheon needs. She had indeed stepped down from the road which was leading her nowhere and cut herself a brand new path. Over time that stall became a store where customers could buy anything from cheese to cookies, and from writing tablets to soles for their worn-out leather shoes. To conclude Annie Johnson\u2019s story I will borrow Angelou\u2019s words from her essay titled \u2018In All Ways a Woman\u2019: \u2018The woman warrior who is armed with wit and courage will be among the first to celebrate victory.\u2019 Angelou's first album, Miss Calypso, produced in 1957, was made possible by the popularity of her nightclub act.The power of her prose is such that it seems as fascinating as poetry. The following lines from the \u2018Power of the Word\u2019 will illustrate what I am alluding to: \u2018I am a big bird winging over high mountains, down into serene valleys. I am ripples of waves on silver seas. I\u2019m a spring leaf trembling in anticipation.\u2019 The reader could easily mistake these lines to be from a poem had they not been told otherwise in advance. Maya Angelou: author, poet, civil rights activist, singer, dancer, professor, first San Francisco woman cable car conductor... the renaissance woman. While writing about her mother, the late Vivian Baxter, she writes, \u2018She practiced stepping off the expected road and cutting herself a brand-new path anytime the desire arose. She inspired me to write the poem \u2018Mrs V. B.\u2019: Ships? Sure I\u2019ll sail them. Show me the boat, If it\u2019ll float, I\u2019ll sail it. Men? Yes, I\u2019ll love them. If they\u2019ve got style, To make me smile, I\u2019ll love them. Life? \u2019Course I\u2019ll live it. Just enough breath, Until my death, And I\u2019ll live it. Failure? I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it, I never learned to spell it. Not Failure. Angelou poses with her book that found her fame and fortune.In the anecdote titled \u2018Complaining\u2019, Angelou\u2019s grandmother is teaching her a few things about life or rather how to lead a better life by fighting against all odds: \u2018So you watch yourself about complaining, sister. What you\u2019re supposed to do when you don\u2019t like a thing is change it. If you can\u2019t change it, change the way you think about it. Don\u2019t complain.\u2019 Maya Angelou framed with President Barack Obama. In \u2018Voices of Respect\u2019, the African-American author writes: \u2018We have used terms to help us survive slavery, its aftermath, and today\u2019s crisis of revived racism. However, now, when too many children run mad in the land, and now, when we need courtesy as much as or more than ever, and when a little tenderness between people could make life more bearable, we are losing even the appearance of courtesy. Our youth, finding little or no courtesy at home, make exodus into streets filled with violent self-revulsion and an exploding vulgarity.\u2019 Replace the word \u2018racism\u2019 with \u2018ethnicity and sectarianism\u2019 and you almost feel that these lines have been written about Pakistan in general, and Karachi in particular. So the youth of the US, the Big Bully, are no better than those of Pakistan. She concludes: \u2018We must recreate an attractive and caring attitude in our homes and in our worlds.\u2019 The same holds true for Pakistan. The audio-book of 'Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now'. In an anecdote titled \u2018Our Boys\u2019 she writes about befriending a Jew while interviewing him for the television programme \u2018Blacks, Blues, Blacks\u2019. However, she is later extremely hurt to learn that he is, in fact, a racist and hates blacks, which is why the first line reads: \u2018Here is a dark little tale which exposes the general pain of racism.\u2019 Had the incident been the other way around, poor Maya Angelou would not only have been labelled an \u2018anti-Semite\u2019 but would also have been blacklisted by the media as well as book publishers.  A painting of Maya Angelou in an African dress.In the essay titled \u2018Jealousy\u2019, she writes, \u2018It must be remembered, however, that jealousy in romance is like salt in food. A little can enhance the savour, but too much can spoil the pleasure and, under certain circumstances, can be life-threatening.\u2019 Do these words need further explanation? I don\u2019t think so as Angelou has herself said it so brilliantly. Angelou's poem on a porcelain mug.",
            "If our children are to approve of themselves, they must see that we approve of ourselves. If we persist in self-disrespect and then ask children to respect themselves, it is as if we break all their bones and then insist that they win Olympic gold medals for the hundred-yard dash. Outrageous. ",
            "Ms. Angelou shares a lot of wisdom in this book...I love it where she states, We need to have the courage to say that obesity is not funny",
            "This book made me feel good to be a woman. The life lessons are wonderful. The chapters are short, but each one pertains to life and our journey through it. ",
            "It's hard to find words to describe how much I loved this book but I'll do my best. Reading this was like talking deeply with a favorite aunt, a wise grandmother, a best friend, and a sister all rolled into one. The wisdom in these words emanates from the woman, that if I'm very lucky, I'll grow to be one day. There are books that just feel good to read, that bring us back to ourselves and remind us about the existence of our soul. Maya angelo reminds us that everything we do, every seed we sew, every energy we put out into the world, shapes the world around us and will directly come back onto us. If I'm sounding biblical, it's because reading this was nearly a religious, and most definitely a spiritual experience.Welcome to my very short list of idols Maya Angelou. The world lost a gem of a soul when you passed, and is all the more dreary and dull for that loss. ",
            "For anyone who hasn't read Maya Angelou I'd run to the closest bookstore. I've read all her books, as I do when I like any author, and I have to say Maya Angelou is beautiful and gracious in all of her books as well as in person. I saw her once in Santa Cruz, Ca. and once in New Mexico and I often think about the regal presence she gave in her presentations. Both a poet and memoir writer, her books speak about life and love and hardship and they don't mess around. In Wouldn't Take Nothing for my Journey Now Maya Angelou gives validity to her own traumatic childhood while validating the childhood of her reader as well. You can start with any of her books you choose and you'll be glad you did.",
            "Aside from a scene at the bar, when the narrator has a breakdown after realizing that despite her stardom she is alone and without a date, I didn't go on an experience in this book--like I do with Maya Angelou's books. ",
            "Another Magnificent Maya Masterpiece!Once again I am blessed to read another book by this wonderful American hero. She gathers her important thoughts and concepts into a series of essays. Each is rich in wisdom. As usual her writing flows very nicely and welcomes the reader into the story. From this style the topics are easily believable. This holiday season I have gifted myself with many Maya Angelou books. This is one that I missed. I am better for it and you will be to should you read them.  My highest recommendation!!!",
            "This book is a collection of Maya Angelou's meditations on a broad range of subjects, from health to manners to memories. I picked it up expecting a quick read, but was unprepared for how quick it really is: there's really very little content, and her meditations are generally only a few paragraphs long. And there wasn't much of a unifying theme, either -- she picks up just about any topic, it seems, offers a few thoughts on the matter, then drops it just as quickly. She seems not to be quite as culturally aware as she might like to think. For example, at one point she says, I am besieged with painful awe at the vacuum left by the dead.... Are they",
            "Maya Angelou discusses life and some of the lessons she\u2019s learned along the way. Faith, racism, grieving, and respect are just a few of the topics included in this book.While most of the lessons this author speaks about were inspiring, there was one in particular which I liked the most. It has to do with moving in new directions. Sometimes you come to a point in which you are not satisfied with the way your life is headed or with the choices you have in front of you. When that happens, Angelou suggests that you have to step off the road and cut yourself a brand-new path. In other words, you have to get creative and make new options for yourself. It always feels rewarding when you can come away from a book feeling like you learned something valuable that you can apply to your own life.",
            "after reading i know why the caged bird sings and singin and swingin and gettin merry... this fall",
            "This is fabulous. I was given this as a gift nearly 20 years ago when I was still in my teens, and just re-read it recently. Full of essays and prose about womanhood, bravery, kindness and confidence. This was my introduction to Maya Angelou, and reading it the second time was as wonderful of an experience as reading it the first time. You can hear her voice - wise and soothing - as you read it, which is an added treat. This is an excellent gift for a woman of any age, especially for a young woman. Curl up with Maya, a cup of coffee or a glass of wine anytime you want to feel a little more connected to all that you are, or connected to the wonderful women in your life. ",
            "Liked this book by Maya Angelou. It was filled with short essays about her experiences and about women. The snippets she provided about her own life picqued my interest to the point that I might see if she has a bio or autobio out there. Update: she has 6 autobiographies. Guess I'll start with 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'. ",
            "The whole of this book is not brilliant. The brilliance is found within the depth of layered meaning, in certain sentences, that contain gold-laden truths. A woman as revered as Maya Angelou, for many, may never be found lacking. Worthy of 5 stars for every body of work she ever brought forth! However, those would be biased reviews.Objectivity leads one to a 3 star rating. Just like Anjanette Barr's Enclaves offering",
            "this was such a great read. perfect for the season in my life that i\u2019m in right now. i\u2019ve never read a Angelou novel but now i want to read more of her works. Angelou\u2019s writing is so beautiful and filled with so much wisdom. ",

            "(Read 6/2009) Wouldn't Take Nothing for my Journey Now and Even the Stars Look Lonesome by Maya Angelou. These two works are not part of the autobiographical series (six books) that begins with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. The two books I am discussing here are more like a collection of small vignettes which discuss various topics.The wonderful thing about these two works and the later book of the same style",
            "What an inane little chapbook this is. If you pulled out all the blank pages, wasted space and chapter titles, I bet this wouldn't end up being 45 pages. It's not to say that the ideas in here aren't good, but they do make this beautiful brain that is Maya Angelou look simple, disjointed and un-put-together (and I've read Caged Bird so I know better). Knowing that it couldn't be further from the truth",
            "This was a great book to read on a lazy vacation in Maryland. I picked it up from a bookshelf in the guest room at the Martin's home. I began reading as I ate a fresh, warm bagel for breakfast. I finished an hour later.Some of my favorite parts...- the story of Miss Annie Johnson who blazed her own trail- Momma's (Maya's grandmother) comments about complainers- the chapter about Getups ie. fashionQuotes:We are more alike",
            "The first book that introduced me to Maya Angelou was  I know why the caged bird sings",
            "In my mind, this book will be archived with the title How to Be. Maya Angelou's writing style is so musical and beautiful; I wished it would go on forever. Alas, it is quite short. I read this in bed on a Sunday morning. But literature does not necessarily need length to be impactful. I trust the hell out of Maya Angelou to tell me how I should live my life, and her anecdotes and opinions regarding womanhood, love, death, style, respect, and virtue are ones I will not soon forget. ",
            "While I love Maya Angelou, this books seemed a little scattered and piecemeal. I would prefer to see her choose a few of the topics she writes about in the book and delve into them further. It was an okay read, but not my favorite of her works."

        "description": "G. K. Chesterton, the \"Prince of Paradox,\" is at his witty best in this collection of twenty essays and articles from the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing on \"heretics\" \u2014 those who pride themselves on their superiority to Christian views \u2014 Chesterton appraises prominent figures who fall into that category from the literary and art worlds. Luminaries such as Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and James McNeill Whistler come under the author's scrutiny, where they meet with equal measures of his characteristic wisdom and good humor.In addition to incisive assessments of well-known individuals (\"Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Making the World Small\" and \"Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants\"), these essays contain observations on the wider world. \"On Sandals and Simplicity,\" \"Science and the Savages,\" \"On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of the Family,\" \"On Smart Novelists and the Smart Set,\" and \"Slum Novelists and the Slums\" reflect the main themes of Chesterton's life's work. Heretics roused the ire of some critics for censuring contemporary philosophies without providing alternatives; the author responded a few years later with a companion volume, Orthodoxy. Sardonic, jolly, and generous, both books are vintage Chesterton.He is criticizing those who hold incomplete and inadequate views about \"life, the universe, and everything.\" He is, in short, criticizing all that host of non-Christian views of reality, as he demonstrated in his follow-up book Orthodoxy. The book is both an easy read and a difficult read. But he manages to demonstrate, among other things, that our new 21st century heresies are really not new because he himself deals with most of them.",

            "Chesterton, let's face it, is thematically ataxic. He can't keep to one idea; in the words of an acquaintance of mine, he sidesteps issues by making sense. Reading Orthodoxy was an experience analogous to hearing an inebriated genius swerve through celestial ideas. The book's only lack is that its subject demands a structure it doesn't provide. Heretics is a different story. Here Chesterton is truest to his form. He's free to roam the world of his improvised ideas as he surveys what he considers both the heretics and heretical ideas of his time, and he does so marvelously, unsurpassed in wit and well-crafted expression. Nearly every page has at least one quotable line, and nearly every page, because his writing is so joyfully digressive, can be read by itself. He was known to send first drafts to publishers and have them accepted without complaint, which should be a point that breaks the pride of any literary dilettante. There's something about this freewheeling, one-shot style that permeates his writing with a sense of spontaneity that would otherwise get muffled out through revision, and this results in a conversational feeling that I can't really find anywhere else. It's as if I can feel his spirit firmly in his words, and what strikes me most is how incomparably jovial and egalitarian he is through them. I can imagine him sharing a conversation with a king and a commoner without missing a relational beat. Chesterton is a joy to read not simply because he is a wordsmith and thinker par excellence, but because he's so impartially down to earth. Human. Imagine that.",
            "Heresy means a belief or opinion contrary to orthodox religious (especially Christian) doctrine and so a heretic would be a person holding such a belief or opinion. It\u2019s a word we don\u2019t use or hear much anymore, probably because we are afraid of certainty in religion. We prefer \u2018tolerance\u2019. This trend was gaining ground in Chesteron\u2019s day. (Wouldn\u2019t you love to hear what he would have to say about our world today?!) Heretics, I was surprised to read in this excellent lecture article by Dale Ahlquist, Chestertonian expert, is one of his most neglected books even though one of his more important. That is indeed a shame because it is superb! Each chapter is a mini-essay about one person, group, or trend which he is critiquing. Although I was only familiar with two individuals mentioned\u2014George Bernard Shaw and Rudyard Kipling\u2014most of Chesterton\u2019s main points were obvious enough and the quotes, as always, were magnificent! Want to come back and read this slowly and carefully, making note of my favorite quotes. Going on to something else now but planning to read Orthodoxy which is sort of like the sequel to Heretics as the former was written in response to the outcry which resulted from the publication of the latter.EXCEPTIONAL!<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>Jan 23, 2018: The thing I like best about G.K. Chesterton is the way he makes me stop short\u2014and I do mean completely stop in my tracks\u2014and say, \u201cWait, what did he just say?! Did he say what I think he said?\u201dYes, he did! Once again, he made or helped me (not sure which) do a complete paradigm shift in my thinking. Lately I have struggled with how to advise my St. Vincent dePaul conference as to problem clients who deceive, scam, refuse to help themselves, etc. Given our limited resources this is cause for frustration to our members. The following quote may be some consolation for them. I know it gave me a new perspective on the situation: \u201cIt is true that there is a thing crudely called charity, which means charity to the deserving poor; but charity to the deserving is not charity at all, but justice. It is the undeserving who require it, and the ideal either does not exist at all, or exists wholly for them.\u201dI also LOVED his chapter on the newspapers. There is NOTHING new under the sun. He saw the American media for what it was back then. (sigh)Still reading\u2026",

            "Chesterton\u2019s clarity of thought and incisiveness of expression never cease to impress and help me. I don\u2019t always agree, and occasionally don\u2019t follow, but I\u2019m always better for it. ",
            "Philosophy in the Edwardian Age7 March 2016\tThis is one of those books that has so much in it that it is literally impossible to cover in a single review. Okay, I probably could do it but the review would be incredibly long and I would probably end up repeating everything Chesterton said in the book, but then again a lot of my reviews end up being a short rehash of what the author said anyway. I guess the reason that I do this is because even if everybody who reads this review puts the book onto the TBR list, if your list is anything like mine then even with all good intentions, you probably won't end up reading the book anyway. This is the beauty of websites like Goodreads \u2013 we can read a book and share what we got from the book and even if the reader of the review never gets to read the book at least they can be influenced to some extent.\tChesterton is an interesting author because most of us think of him as simply being an author of detective fiction but never realise that he actually wrote philosophic texts as well. Granted, Chesterton was a Christian and his writings tend to be that of an orthodox Christian, but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing. To be honest the main reason that I wanted to read Chesterton was not so much because he wrote detective fiction but rather because he wrote Christian philosophy and influenced the likes of C.S. Lewis. When I discovered that Slavoj Zizek also heavily referenced him I became even more intrigued.\tAs you can probably guess, this book is about heresy, however it is not necessarily about any old heresy but rather about what he considered heresy, from the point of view of an orthodox Christian, at the turn of the 20th Century. Mind you, some of the writers that he speaks about we have probably never heard of simply because they disappeared into the mists of history. However there are other writers, such as  Rudyard Kipling,  George Bernard Shaw, and  H.G. Wells whose writings have come down to us today and are still very popular (and considering that Hollywood seem to want to rehash the Wells stories every decade or so is evidence of that). Oh, and I should probably add that while he is exploring the ideas of these authors from a Christian perspective, he isn't writing in the same vein of some modern writers, who claim that anybody who reads the Harry Potter books are on a slippery slope to hell. Sure, he may be critical of the ideas, but he never actually attacks the person, and even goes as far as to suggest he even likes some of these author's works, despite disagreeing with their premise.\tHowever, the problem with exploring the ideas that have come out of this book is that these writers are so different in there philosophies that one has to look at them each individually. There are some overarching themes that come out of each of them, such as Shaw's search for the Superman and Wells' search for his utopian society. In a way they are different, but in a way they are the same in that they see the possibility of humanity evolving through their own willpower \u2013 with Shaw this is evolution on and individual basis whereas with Wells' this is evolution on a social basis. Mind you, when this was being written it was a popular belief that humanity had finally evolved beyond the need for war and was on the cusp of a golden age of peace and prosperity. With the exception of the Crimean War the last major European War was the Napoleonic Wars a hundred years previously. The catch is that this was from an English perspective because they didn't consider the Franco-Prussian War as a proper war simply because they weren't involved, and nor did they consider their colonial wars proper wars either because they were fought against people they considered savages.\tThe criticism of Kipling is interesting because we are seeing one huge change that is coming about in the western world: the tyranny of distance is being defeated. With the advent of the steam train, and then the motor car (and then the aeroplane) travel that used to take days, or even months, was now taking a lot less time. However the problem that he sees (that we in the 21st Century don't see as much) is that there is no longer an attachment to a locality. The town in which we live ceases to be our universe and starts to be a place. I remember growing up in Adelaide - when I didn't have all that much money, Adelaide was my universe, a universe that had boundaries. However once I get a job and could afford holidays Adelaide ceased to be a universe and started to become a place. At first the universe was limited to the Australian continent, but upon my first trip overseas the universe expanded once again. Mind you, despite wandering around Europe and England (and despite the fact that I have this strange attachment to London) the one place where I feel comfortable, and feel at home, is here in Australia.\tIt is interesting reading Chesterton's book because in a way it seems that very little has changed in the hundred odd years since he wrote it, though in some ways things seem to have changed a lot. In Chesterton's era we are on the cusp of a transformation that has been created by the industrialised age. New philosophies are coming about and the old philosophies of the past are being discarded. From Chesterton's view point he sees that we have a choice in what philosophy we embrace \u2013 spiritualism or secularism. From my vantage point of 2016 I can clearly see which philosophy we ended up embracing (though it is interesting that he claimed that when he wrote this book talking about God, or the non-existance of God, was not something that was done in polite company).\tHowever we always seem to be in a period of flux, a period where we can chose which way we will head. These days it is a question of whether we vote for prosperity or for the Earth. Do we vote for Trump or do we vote for the other person. Mind you, in my mind a vote for Trump is a complete unknown, but at least with the US system of primaries they get to choose the nominee the party puts forward for president. Here in Australia we have a choice of two people \u2013 Shorten and Turnball, neither of whom inspire me with any confidence.\tAnyway, enough of politics because all that seems to be flooding my Facebook feed these days (depending on which group you subscribe to \u2013 I doubt the Wodonga Crochet Club talks about voting for Trump, or anybody else, nor does Cat Addicts Anony-mouse). The final thing I wish to bring up though is an interesting thing that Chesterton mentions near the end of the book: the idea of law. Apparently in the middle ages when a law as created the law applied to everybody \u2013 the duke included (though for some reason I don't think that is entirely true). However these days laws tend to be very specific, in that they target the poor as opposed to the rich. His example is the blasphemy law, which is in effect the law against using foul language. The aristocracy don't use foul language, the common people do, so the aristocracy is unlikely to be caught by this law. This is very clear in our day because the aristocrats can get away with things that us ordinary plebs can't. For instance if I am working for an investment bank and buy shares (or sell shares) before a big deal is released to the market then I am guilty of insider trading. However is the managing director of the investment bank retires, and sells all of his shares before a major crash then he is a canny business man. The same thing is the case with pensions \u2013 if I am on a pension and am also earning income from a side job, then I am double dipping and guilty of a crime. However if a former politician takes a job after retiring on a government pension then, well, that is okay.",
            "Obviously, this is G.K. Chesterton so I am going to love it. However, probably my least favorite of the books I've read by him. It feels somewhat random and thrown together. I can see how it paved the way for Orthodoxy",
            "Look it\u2019s really good, but it would be probably much better if the person reading knew beforehand the authors whom he calls \u201cheretics, I didn\u2019t know, I could still understand what he was saying. Maybe the author himself could have explained better what were the thoughts and writings of these folks. ",
            "This was the first book I read from Chesterton and I have to admit that, even though it was a bit difficult to follow, I found it genius. It is very difficult to classify this book, but I believe it is a great source of criticism to some modern addictions such as progress, beauty, democracy and anti-religion. I liked it very much by the fact that he manages to criticize in a very respectful and objective way. He destroys the ideals of several important novelists and philosophers by using characteristics of human nature and metaphors which make it clearer to everybody.Chesterton has the great ability of taking you by the hand and explaining everything so clearly that you may think if anybody disagrees, he is not an intelligent person. I recommend it for religious people, for you to have weapons and rational arguments to defend religion. And I recommend it for anti-religious, for you to understand life.",
            "To explain my review. The concepts in the book aren't all that bad, I'm really just not a fan of the constant use of paradox and empty maxims. It was a fairly grueling read in that it was unnecessarily full of these fillers. However, there were some genuine gems in here, and the book got relatively better heading towards the later chapters. Here are some quotes that I quite enjoyed:It is a sufficient proof that we are not an essentially democratic state that we are always wondering what we shall do with the poor.We have laws against blasphemy ... but we have no laws against heresy \u2013 that is the intellectual poisoning of the whole people",
            "Review title: Life is always a novelIn the decades since his death, I imagine Mr. Chesterton has been bounding about Heaven in an unfeigned energy of pure virginal (his term) faith and and delight in its wonders, perhaps trading epigrams with Oscar Wilde (who would not be the only forgiven sinner in Paradise) in joyous competition, and quoting with delight the words of that new young songwriter Jimmy Buffett the more we learn the less we know.OK",
            "No review by me could even remotely begin to do justice to the wit and wisdom in GK Chesterton's book Heretics.I read this book at the recommendation of my son, Alan. I'm glad he encouraged me \u2013 strongly, I might add \u2013 to read Heretics. Next, I will read Orthodoxy.Although Chesterton wrote in a different time and on a different continent, his words have strong application for what we are facing today with postmodernism, pluralism, and a new kind of religion called tolerance, which is really intolerant of any other view.Chesterton shows a breadth of understanding and appreciation of the art, literature, and philosophy of his day. He was a good-natured man who was friends with people with whom he disagreed. In Heretics, he discusses the worldviews and works of people like Richard Kipling, Bernard Shaw, HG Wells, George Moore, Lowes Dickinson, and many others.I was truly amazed at the breath of understanding that Chesterton has with his culture along with his ability to disagree in an agreeable, friendly, and joyous way.I'm sure that if I was more conversant with the literature, philosophy, and politics of his day then I would have an even greater appreciation for Chesterton's repartee. Trying to keep up with him in conversation would, no doubt, expose most of us as intellectual lightweights.Chesterton believes that the most practical and important thing about a man is his view of the universe. Therefore, Chesterton begins with the first things \u2013 one's worldview. Ideas matter to Chesterton. He believes that one should search out the truth and then hold to one's position vigorously and with good will and humor.Chesterton isn't fooling around. He says about Bernard Shaw, I am concerned with him as a heretic \u2013 that is to say",
            "This book contains some really fascinating ideas, but it also has some really confusing ones. It would have helped if I had a more thorough understanding of the philosophies of Chesterton\u2019s day. Also, I\u2019m looking forward to reading Orthodoxy which might explain some of what I read here. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but when reading Chesterton you have to remember that he is primarily a philosopher not a theologian. However, here are some of the ideas which I thought were particularly thought provoking. \u2022\tIdeas have consequences. Chesterton was an idea guy, and this book is full of ideas which Chesterton agreed and disagreed with. He points out the obvious but often overlooked fact that what we believe affects what we do. He shows that he believes this emphatically when he says, \u201cWe think that for a landlady considering a lodger, it is important to know his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run, anything else affects them.\u201d\u2022\tTo know England is to hate the world. In Heretics, Chesterton singles out a couple of authors and examines the flaws in their philosophies. One author that Chesterton examines is Rudyard Kipling. One of the ideas that Chesterton critiques is the naivety of Kipling asking \u201cin a celebrated epigram what they can know of England who know England only.\u201d Chesterton points out that to know anything well you must attach yourself to it. His illustration is that of understanding ancient civilizations. He says, \u201cThey are ancient civilizations with strange virtues buried like treasures. If we wish to understand them it must not be as tourists or inquirers, it must be with the loyalty of children and the great patience of poets.\u201d\u2022\tThe success of humility. One objection to Christianity that Chesterton deals with is the accusation that Christian success and humility can\u2019t coincide. He turns that idea on its head by saying that humility is the only way for a Christian to succeed. He says, \u201cThe truth is that there are no things for which men will make such herculean efforts as the things of which they know they are unworthy. There never was a man in love who did not declare that, if he strained every nerve to breaking, he was going to have his desire. And there never was a man in love who did not declare also that he ought not to have it.\u201d\u2022\tTruth indefinable but not unattainable. Chesterton responds to H. G. Wells attacks on the certainty of Truth by asserting that Truth must be attainable. Wells asserted that, \u201cThere is no abiding thing in what we know.\u201d Chesterton cleverly responds by saying that in order to know that what we know has changed there must be some similarity for the difference to be relevant. So",
            "Not as good as Orthodoxy, but, then, nothing is as good as Orthodoxy. It's better than most anything else though. ",
            "Chesterton was a jovial, good-natured man, known for his raucous laughter and his love for naps and good beer. But Chesterton was also criticized for his joy, particularly criticized for how many jokes he made at his opponents\u2019 expense. Heretics exhibits that style of jovial criticism, as in its pages Chesterton contests the philosophies and the philosophers of his day, but does so with wit and flair.The chapters of this book are each devoted to a different writer or thinker of Chesterton\u2019s day, as he tears down their ideas one at a time. Some names are recognizable today, while others have disappeared into the forgotten past.I give this book a rating of 3 out of 5 with some regret, because I found great enjoyment in its pages. But the primary weakness of the book is its strong ties to the past; many of the ideas and persons described within are no longer known to today\u2019s society. While the chapter on H. G. Wells still carries some interest for today\u2019s reader, there is little need for us to dwell on the weaknesses of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.As to the book\u2019s strong suits, I thought the opening to be one of the most profound I have ever read. Chesterton described our modern world turned on its head, as illustrated by our use of the words \u201corthodoxy\u201d and \u201cheretic\u201d:The word 'heresy' not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means being clear-headed and courageous. The word 'orthodoxy' not only no longer means being right; it practically means being wrong. All this can mean one thing",
            "His best essay collection where he discusses ideas of his contemporaries. This makes you realize how modern public intellectual debates and whatnot are completely vapid compared to the lively discussion of early 20th century England where you had people like Chesterton, Kipling, Bernard Shaw, Wells, Belloc and a few others being what Dawkins and Lane Craig are today. Ye old days were at least in this much more interesting.",
            "For a few years, I heard numerous references to Chesterton. I'm sure I will dive into his work and it's so good to know he has a long bibliography. He was a genius, a brilliant thinker and I wish I could find more conservatives like him. The quality of our argument depends a lot on the quality of our oponents. His ability to create/point out paradoxes makes his writting at the same time piercing and wity, challenging and delightful. ",
            "Before revisiting Orthodoxy, I decided to pick up Heretics first since Chesterton wrote it first and the reaction to it prompted him to write Orthodoxy. I am so glad I did. It may not quite reach the level of the positive and beautiful statement that is Orthodoxy, but there are so many quotable and insightful passages written against modern skepticism as only Chesterton can. Here\u2019s a little taste:\u201cThey would make us simple in the things that do not matter-- that is, in diet, in costume, in etiquette, in economic system. But they would make us complex in the things that do matter--in philosophy, in loyalty, in spiritual acceptance, and spiritual rejection. It does not so very much matter whether a man eats a grilled tomato or a plain tomato; it does very much matter whether he eats a plain tomato with a grilled mind\u201d (Chapter 10).\u201cScience in the modern world has many uses; its chief use, however, is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich\u201d (Chapter 13).\u201cThe people (as I tactfully pointed out to them) who really take the name of the Lord in vain are the clergymen themselves. The thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is not a careless joke. The thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is a careless solemnity\u201d (Chapter 16).\u201cSome hold the undemonstrable dogma of the existence of God; some the equally undemonstrable dogma of the existence of the man next door\u201d (Chapter 20).In Heretics, Chesterton turns humanist modernism on its head. He presents deep and profound truths in such a way as to make them seem obvious and make the reader feel foolish for not having seen them before. Above all, Chesterton sees the beauty and glory and joy in the things God has created and in the unique nature of Man whom he created to experience and enjoy them. It's wonderful to see modernist Reason getting the stuffing kicked out, not in spite of, but especially being vocational scientist myself. Chesterton gets some things wrong, to be sure, but he has a way of cutting through the nonsense that poses as sense in some quarters of our world.",
            "Insightful and witty as you would expect from Chesterton. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this one. It\u2019s not about Marcion, Arius, and Pelagius, it\u2019s about popular thinkers & artists like HG Wells, Rudyard Kipling, and others in the author\u2019s day that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of as heretics, but were espousing very non-Christian ideas in British culture. He brings out their doctrines and philosophies in entertaining and unexpected ways. Definitely not as good as Orthodoxy (one of my all-time favorite books). Also, there were times where I was for the first time kind of annoyed by Chesterton\u2019s seemingly endless ability to be contrary. If you think the neck tie should be white, he\u2019ll demonstrate in brilliant language why it should be black or purple. If you think America is a young country compared to Britain, he\u2019ll insist that It is America that is old. He was obviously brilliant, but sometimes comes across like the guy everyone knew in junior high who always responded with... well.. actually...",
            "There are amazing books which are worth five stars, and then there's Heretics which deserves a sixth star for its writer's exceptional genius. Now, I am in a real state of excitement. I will make sure to write a decent review as soon as I become moderately excited (not that I consider excess of excitment as something bad. I'm just too excited to be able to steady my fingers and write something comprehensible.)For the time being, here are two of my many favourite sentences in the book:[N]o man ought to write at all, or even to speak at all, unless he thinks that he is in truth and the other man in error. In similar style, I hold that I am dogmatic and right, while Mr. Shaw is dogmatic, and wrong.",
            "My experience with Chesterton is that he leads you in circles around an idea, with metaphor upon metaphor, and paradox upon paradox, making you feel like you weren't following any argument at all. To your surprise, abruptly meeting once again with sense, apparently being on track all along. In heretics, we see him using this in the context of refuting many of the predominant views of that day, those that challenged some cardinal (and some inconsequential) tenets of christianity. This book is argument using the perfect balance of prose and verse. I would have feared to be the subject of one of Chesterton's savagely witty refutations.",

My main complaint with this is there is a steady rhythm jumping from the perspective of character to character, which keeps things dynamic and engaging, until about two thirds in, when each chapter suddenly becomes a free-for-all of new names, new bureaucracies , and new intrigues that felt piled onto the third act in a race to finish the book in order to get to the next in the series (which I will hopefully be able to acquire in this current crisis).Also, ****spoiler**** , but Tepper really knows how to write an inter-species romance.",

I didn't feel any of the characters were real or sympathetic - everyone was just a piece of the world building.

            "As much as I dearly dearly dearly love Victoria Hanley I just couldn't with this book. The character development was utter bollocks to be quite honest. POV's change so often that continuity becomes an issue. When you are just beginning to get in the groove of one character's voice you are tossed into another's. It especially threw me off when we randomly enter the POV of someone who never had a POV throughout the book until it was convenient to the plot. Or they were an altogether random character. Prime example is Evan, he has one half a paragraph POV when he is going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Wtf? Whyyyy?? You could have revealed what happened through a less obvious conveyor Hanley. I feel like you cheat a lot with this book for the sake of ease for you. Like when a character catches everyone up to speed, So Jasper told them everything that happened",
            "This and my other reviews can be found at http://amethystbookwyrm.blogspot.co.uk/Two new students arrive at the Healer\u2019s Keep who are hiding secrets, Dorjan is the first foreigner to be admitted to the Keep and can walk in others dreams, and Sara is the daughter of Kind Landon and Queen Torina. Across the ocean in Sliviia, slave girl Maeve is bought by the evil Lord Morlen and manages to run away with the help of Jasper, who has remained free using his wits. These four destiny are linked together to stop the dark forces taking control of the world. The Healer\u2019s Keep is the sequel to The Seer and The Sword, and is a good book but I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as the first book. This is because the characters were hard to connect to especially Dorjan and Sara, but I did like Maeve and Jasper more. I would recommend this book the fans of The Seer and The Sword.",
            "Since I probably won't do a review of this on my blog: Just some quick thoughts. This was definitely a completely different vein of book than its predecessor, The Seer & The Sword, which is undoubtedly one of the best YA Fantasies from the early 2000's. I felt like this book copied many of the plot elements of the first book (not in scope, but in small details; for example, magic drugs are used to sedate people, poison is force-drunk by the poisoner, things like that - that were unique in the first book, but weirdly redundant in the second). There are four characters in the novel: Maeve, Jasper, Sara & Dorjan. My favorite was Jasper b/c he was the most steadfast & had the most present scenes. The best aspect of the novel was the characterizations of its four main characters - it felt very Tamora Pierce Circle of Magic. ",
            "This is the second book in a trilogy and the companion to The Seer and the Sword. Enjoyed this very convoluted story with many twists and turns most of which were unanticipated. A good read and a good young adult lit book",
            "More proof that I keep underestimating Victoria Hanley. While this wasn't quite as fabulous as The Seer and the Sword - I found the first half absolutely riveting and the second half somewhat rushed and confusing - it was more original by far and still a great read. I actually really liked the dream-travel premise (it's something I've toyed with writing about myself, although I think this author did a far better job than i would have) and don't understand why so many of my fellow reviewers find it so creepy. The characters were likable - Jasper was refreshingly unpredictable, Maeve and Dorjan were fiery and amiable, and I'm glad nothing drastically awful happened to Evan; although admittedly I found Sara a little bit irritating at times. A few things still left me feeling confused at the end; as I've already said, the last half of the book was really rather confusing and harried at times. Still, it definitely packed suspense, intrigue, and creativity, and it wasn't at all bad for a twenty-years-in-the-future sequel novel. I'll almost definitely check out The Light of the Oracle, which i'm pretty sure rounds out the trilogy.",
            "When I read Hanley's The Seer and the Sword, I concluded that it had good characters, but not enough worldbuilding. Oddly, Hanley's second book, The Healer's Keep, suffers from the opposite problem. It's set in the same world and follows the adventure of four teenagers who are fighting the mysterious Shadow King, who is trying to take over the Healer's Keep (where two of the teens are studying magic) and then the world. Though the world (particularly the Keep) is well thought-out, none of the characters really came to life for me, perhaps because so much story was stuffed into one book that characterization was sketchy and the action was over-hurried. Again, Hanley's ideas have potential, but at least for me, she hasn't quite hit her stride yet. ",
            "Strong lead characters, including strong female leads, contribute to driving a great adventure, replete with interesting and unusual magic. The evil-doing villain in this book is so scary, I felt sick. Fantastic to see a genuinely scary, evil villain, that does not rely on twisted torture scenes or graphic violence to show his evilness (I am so sick of vividly described torture in fantasy novels - there should be a warning on the cover)- just portrayed through his steely gaze and powerful magic abilities. Really like that characters are shown as caring for friends and accepting kindness from strangers, and that good actions, while increasing the danger and tension in the moment, are ultimately rewarded. One of those stay up all night until you have finished books.Also posted on my blog http://misspossumbooklove.blogspot.co...",

Nothing was developed with detail, even the great evil wasn't really explained, so the fight 'against' it didn't feel like it was a big deal. So many unsatisfying convenient things happened, like certain characters running into each other and falling in love, or grandmother's saving the day, and a merc with a contract happens to know the emperor and will get a singer to them. Also, everyone somehow knows how to use their gifts WITHOUT ANY TRAINING? None of the characters had any personality",
            "Maeve, beloved slave of some guy. She was just like a daughter to him. He had her report to him once a year, just so he could watch her progress. Apparently, that was enough contact to create a parental bond. He loved her so much, that he stationed her in the massage parlour where she got to massage horny, naked men all day. Um... Yeah.It didn't get any better from there. Evil badguy has infiltrated the healer's keep. One of the people in charge knows that. But since nobody was going to believe her, she just kept her mouth shut and let it happen. It's been a while since I've seen writing that lazy and sloppy. ",
            "Compared to the Seer and the Sword I felt the plot in this book was rushed. The beginning was interesting and made me want to know more until it moved to Sara and then the plot began to move super fast. All the characters felt bland and the book didn't give me much time to really get to know any of them. Also, there was a lot of things happening of page like the sudden change of the Supreme Seer. He went from, The Queen is a fraud! To I'm a horrible person and I'll help. Felt rushed.",
            "This book was great in some aspects, but some places in the book were weak and desperate for attention and suspense. Hanley wanted a quick-moving plot, she\u2019s got it, but that doesn\u2019t make it great. So it\u2019s more of an ehhhhh for me.",
            "Loved this sequel. Forgot tons about the first book, but lots came back. I love how she totally screwed things up and then worked hard to repair as much as possible. The magics were also fun.",
            "Bumping down to 3 stars on a re-read.There are things about this story I really love. The concept is cool and the possibilities endless, but she really tries to bite off too much in this novel with very tenuous links between two EXTREMELY different countries and two EXTREMELY different worlds.The beginning of this novel and the setup are identical to The Seer and the Sword though, and it looks like a very poor second. It also makes it a very annoying trope. I absolutely hated Sara. The main heroine is some stubborn, headstrong, and vivacious spirit. The quiet, mature hero just happens to fall in love with her, but she's seduced away by the falsely charming, evil male. She realizes her wrong and comes crying back to the hero and keeps thinking Oh how he must hate me so!The villains weren't very thoroughly explained in this book or in the first book. The first book was easier to chalk it up to that's just the nature of the character",
            "So\u2026 the book was pretty good. It\u2019s set in a fantasy world where people can see in to the present and the future, transport themselves with their minds, walk through other people\u2019s dreams and even feel someone\u2019s essence simply by touching them. An interesting story that moved along pretty well, not too fast or slow. My only real problem that kept me from really fully enjoying it is that there were way too many moments in which the main characters were just too helpless. It wasn\u2019t as frustrating as when characters make unreasonably stupid decisions\u2026 it was almost worse.For example, there was a scene where an evil man was about to take an object of great value from one of the lead females. NOTE that there are two other lead characters in the same room, standing right next to the lead female with the object from what I gathered. So what great feat does this evil man do to wrest the object away from all three of these people? He simply walks up to her and takes it from her. Nobody stops him. And I just don\u2019t understand it. Nobody even tries to stop him. Yes, I get that the female character was frightened and may have frozen with fear, but what about the other two, who didn\u2019t even say anything? What the heck were they so occupied with off to the side? And then they want to spring into action after the evil man\u2019s gone. FACEPALMI understood that for this story, a lot of things needed to go wrong before they could start to get better, but there was just a point where it was just too much. I almost threw the book across the room.I consider it a good thing when I book raises strong emotions in me, but not when it\u2019s hate towards the book.Plus the ending felt too abrupt for me.Three stars.=Doyin",
            "This review was originally posted on my blog,  Creativity's Corner This book was worth taking my time with. It surprised me in so many ways and yet looking back, I should have seen them coming.One of the things I loved was the characters. They were extremely vivid in my mind. I could see Maeve serving Lord Morlen, and hear her beautiful voice as she talked to Jasper. I felt Sara's pain at Bern's betrayal and her own stupidity. Each character caught and held my interest for the entire story.But the main thing I liked about this book was that it felt like high fantasy, but was much more accessible. If you've ever read JRR Tolkein or Robert Jordan and given up because it got too complicated, then this is the novel for you. For most of the book Hanley maintained several different story lines jumping between them every few chapters. The difference is that Hanley's stories are easy to remember and there aren't so many different storylines that you lose track of what happened to who. At first it is a little difficult to see how the stories relate, but that is quickly solved, and I was soon drawn into trying to figure out how she was going to join the two stories up, without having the characters completely miss each other.So overall, I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels.",
            "Wonderful! Like The Seer and the Sword, this book has a very engaging plot with memorable and strong characters. Readers should pay close attention to the storytelling in this book though, as it's easy to get confused among all the epicness. You don't have to read the first book to understand this one either, The Healer's Keep stands alone beautifully.The fantasy was a little over my head compared to the first one, (like all the dreaming stuff) but I loved the story to bits, especially the characters! I\u2019m glad that Torina and Landen make a reappearance too, I squeed upon that discovery.As usual, the villains are awesome and hateable. ;) Like SOOOO HATEABLE, it makes me wanna punch 'em!"

Also, I felt like the hero changed, and I became angry with him. Average historical romance. Not the best Karen Ranney book out there.Margaret Esterly is a widow. Michael Hawthorne, Earl of Montraine, happens to meet Margaret quite by chance and becomes instantly obsessed with her (overthrowing his reserved, planned life as a cryptographist) . Margaret is forced to sell one of three of volumes of The Journals of Augustin X, which are a risqu\u00e9 collection of travel stories.

            "Pass the Azo, please. Memories Schmemories: After the Kiss by Karen Ranney. Isn't it wonderful when you are hooked from the very first paragraph? From the opening pages to the end, this book was a treat to read. It starts out with a fire in a book store/home of our heroine Margaret. Margaret is able to grab a box by the bedside, awaken her maid Penelope and escape through a window. Margaret's husband is not so lucky, he perishes in the fire. Before this first chapter ends we are also introduced to the villain of the book. There is never any question in this story who was responsible for Margaret's husband's death; the only question we left with is when will this guy strike again.Time passes. Margaret and Penelope are sharing a small house in the country, but they are in need of money. When her house was destroyed by the fire, Margaret happened to grab a box and in that box were three volumes of what was called the Journals of Augustin X. Well, these journals are in actuality bawdy books and there are a number of men who are willing to pay a pretty high price to own them. While Margaret has enjoyed viewing the books and having her eyes opened a bit on just how flexible a human being can be, she also likes to eat. She decides to take one of the books to the highest bidder. She journeys to London and arrives at the house of the man who is going to buy the journal. Well, it just so happens he is having a costume party. After the transaction Margaret wonders out onto the terrace, attracted by the music and there she meets Michael Hawthorne, Earl of Montraine. Michael mistakenly thinks her shabby clothes are a costume and that she is an aristocrat. Michael and Margaret are immediately attracted to each other and not just physically. They share a moment of lovely companionship and a kiss. But, much like Cinderella, Margaret disappears into the night leaving Michael to wonder about her. Or should I say obsess about her, because she becomes someone he just simply cannot forget.Time passes. Penelope wants to marry a local man and Margaret wants to give her something special. In order to do that she decides she must sell the second book. She returns to town, only this time instead of the man she sold it to the first time she finds Michael waiting for her. For months both Michael and Margaret have been obsessing about each other. Michael has asked his friend to let him know if the mysterious woman makes contact with him. He has been unable to concentrate on his work, which is cyphering (he's a spy or something). He must get her out of his system - somehow. Let me just say - this scene was hot! He asks her for one more kiss, only a kiss. They go to his house for that kiss. Well, it turns into something a great deal more than just a measly little kiss. Fan please. It is a night full of hot, pulsing, sweaty stuff. Then Margaret leaves in the morning, because she must. She has no place in Michael's life, she knows it and he knows it. But he cannot forget her, so he finds her. Michael must find a rich wife, so the only thing that Margaret could be is a mistress. They are people from two different social strati and they are really really really attracted to each other.Time passes. Margaret is pregnant but doesn't tell Michael. She turns down Michael's offer of being a mistress, but maybe they could spend a week together. Then after the week go their own way. We all know that much like the only one kiss",
            "This is my first book by this author and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. There was real chemistry between Michael and Margaret.After a fire that consumes her husband and their livelihood, Margaret finds 3 books in the strongbox that holds the money from their business. She decides to try to sell one to one of the three men her husband had indicated would be interested in the books. While leaving the home of the buyer, she hears music and pauses in the darkened garden to listen for a few minutes. There, she meets an attractive man. When they are interrupted by one of Michael's acquaintances, Margaret slips out of the garden and back to the carriage.Michael is so taken with her that he searches for her. Finally, his friend realizes that Michael is referring to the woman who was selling the book. Michael is going to parties to find a wealthy wife. Margaret will not suit because she is an impoverished commoner. Margaret also realizes that the interest that they have in each other can not lead to happiness. However, their interest in each other will not be tamped down by its impossibility.",
            "Ten\u00eda mis dudas porque parec\u00eda una nueva versi\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica de Ceniciente, y aunque s\u00ed es, tiene su propio encanto principalmente por la personalidad bastante compleja de los protagonistas y el conflicto amoroso.

            "Not great. Some parts are irritating especially hero\u2019s selfish behavior. Mystery was interesting, but had to skim parts to get there. Beginning was very slow and dragging. Also hero and heroine stoned on about being in love with minimal interaction which was a bit unbelievable. ",

            "Despu\u00e9s de besarte es una novela que, a trav\u00e9s de personajes sencillos y situaciones que no se alejan de lo usual, teje una historia intensa que te cautiva con facilidad, en la que abundan la sensualidad y la dulzura. A trav\u00e9s de sus p\u00e1ginas asistimos al sutil cambio de Michael y Margaret, dos personas que se supon\u00eda no estaban destinadas a estar juntas, pero que los caprichos de la providencia parece pensar de otro modo.La evoluci\u00f3n de los personajes es lenta y paulatina. Poco a poco, a trav\u00e9s de los encuentros que se producen entre ambos y la convivencia, somos testigos de c\u00f3mo cada uno va desprendi\u00e9ndose de las encorsetadas normas que los oprim\u00edan e imped\u00edan demostrar su verdadera cara. Michael es un hombre estricto, austero y distante. La dif\u00edcil infancia vivida le ha convertido en un hombre que huye de las emociones. Prefiere la l\u00f3gica y racionalidad de los n\u00fameros y los c\u00f3digos. Los sentimientos no son tan f\u00e1ciles de desentra\u00f1ar. Margaret es un mujer sencilla, hu\u00e9rfana desde muy temprana edad. Pese a ello siempre se ha sentido protegida y cuidada, primero por su abuelo y luego por su marido, pero la pasi\u00f3n es totalmente nueva para ella. Algo que descubre en los brazos de Michael.En realidad la trama de la novela no es especialmente novedosa. Nos encontramos ante dos personas que pertenecen a mundos opuestos, donde ninguno tiene cabida en el del otro, pero las circunstancias o el destino parecen decidir otra cosa. El interrogante se encuentra en saber c\u00f3mo har\u00e1n para eliminar ese obst\u00e1culo, ya que no lo olvidemos la historia transcurre en torno a 1820, donde la sociedad no era como la hoy conocemos. De fondo subyace toda una trama que gira en torno a los misteriosos diarios, y aunque desde un principio sabemos qui\u00e9n los persigue -de modo que no hay ning\u00fan misterio- s\u00ed que se permanece a la espera de cu\u00e1ndo y por qu\u00e9 acechar\u00e1 este personaje.Mientras esto sucede, la autora nos deleita con una historia de amor que te mantiene en vilo, entrelazando di\u00e1logos ingeniosos, sensuales y una complicidad entre sus protagonistas que traspasa f\u00e1cilmente las p\u00e1ginas. Una historia que en ocasiones tiene ciertos toques a cuento de hadas, a mi parecer. En cierto modo la escena del baile es un poco parecida a la de la cenicienta y el pr\u00edncipe, y las hermanas de Michael, a m\u00ed personalmente me recuerdan un poco las hermanastras de \u00e9sta. Creo que la escritora ha logrado escribir una novela profunda, sencilla y con mucha sensualidad, una historia dulcemente rom\u00e1ntica que te garantiza una muy agradable lectura.",

I have accumulated a lot of books since I first started reading romance and now I don't really remember why some of them were added to my shelves but I am determined to read them all and find out. This book is mostly about the relationship between Michael and Margaret. I usually like books that are character driven and I was happy when I realized this one was one of those. The characters are sympathetic, Michael is a repressed and rational man who suddenly finds himself doing all sorts of irrational things due to his attraction to Margaret, and Margaret is a sensible woman, determined to live alone and support herself, who finds herself going against her moral principles because of her attraction to Michael.I think this could have worked really well for me but in the end I felt that there was not enough character development and complexity to fully convince me. Margaret's decision to have a child out of wedlock and Michael's decision to not look for a rich bride (who could save his estates) and instead marry a penniless commoner should have been thought of and analyzed and debated a lot more I think. As it is, it ended up feeling a bit too light a read. Entertaining yes",

It's an example of what Karen Ranney can do really well - thoughtful main characters, with conflicts that don't feel artificial in their relationship, and very sensual sex scenes (without being extremely graphic). The historical accuracy was not a particular strength, with overly-easy overcoming of class boundaries, and there's a code-breaking spy plot (a thing I particularly do not enjoy), but these did not really spoil the book for me.",

At fifty, he has survived imprisonment for murdering his wife, years of venomous hate mail from the British public and, most recently, the suicide of his daughter Sadie. Willy needs a break, but he's not going to get it. While recuperating from a heart attack in a Mexican resort with his magnificently silly girlfriend Penny and his vodka-drenched friend Harry, Willy finds himself drawn into a troubling confrontation with the past. As he becomes engrossed in Sadie's tragic diaries, he reluctantly considers his chaotic family history and the notion that \"only when you die do you run out of chances to be good.\" With her scathing wit and brilliant ear for dialogue, Zo\u00eb Heller has created a darkly humorous story of love and loathing, sex and death, and filial relations gone horribly awry.

            "The first Zoe Heller novel I read, The Believers, left me manically scouring the library for more of her work. I found Everything You Know; a novel with characters easily as cringe-worthy as the Litvinoffs who feature in The Believers. It is the story of Willy Muller whose life has a delightful awfulness about it. Written in the first person narrative, Heller treats the reader to Willy's sarcastic, witty outlook, his superbly droll thoughts and wry observations. He has a dim-witted girlfriend, one daughter just wants to fleece him, the other has recently posted him her diaries and then committed suicide. He's been commissioned to write the screenplay for his book based on a most unfortunate incident in his life and to top it off, he's just had a heart attack. Willy deals with all these trials in a manner which is comically unrelenting: he has some truly memorable experiences in Mexico to where he escapes to write the aforementioned screenplay and some equally sad and pathetic moments in London when he visits to attend the funeral of his German-born English-resenting mother. Some of Willy's observations of his fellow characters were uproarious and had me laughing out loud:\u201c The first person to greet us was Sissy Yerxa, looking like a lipsticked ferret in a very short skirt and an electric pink halter-neck.\u201d\u201cHe had a long arrow mouth and almost no lips \u2013 his mouth was just an unannounced slit in the final third of his face, like a muppet's.\u201dBelatedly, Willy is offered the thought:  \u201cOnly when you die do you run out of chances to be good. Until then, there is the possibility of turning yourself around\u201d. And this is indeed a thought that Heller poses for the reader to consider. Even if your life situation is not as precarious as is Willy's, just when do your chances to redeem yourself run out? Ostensibly, I love Heller's warts and all portrayal of her character and that she provides no pretty window dressings in her novel. Everything You Know is indeed a tragi-comedy; a story which charmed me and made me wince in equal measures. A definite 4\u2605. Note: my copy was Large Print.",
            "Willy Muller is a truly horrible person. His wife died from a fall that may, or may not, have resulted from him shoving her. One of his daughters won\u2019t talk to him, and the other one, also estranged, committed suicide. One of her last acts before ending her life was to send Willy 11 years of her journals, and he responds to the posthumous package with deep callousness. \u201cShe had succumbed to the sentimentalities of leave-taking,\u201d he says. \u201cChrist, isn\u2019t life hard enough without that sort of hokey melodrama?\u201dYet Willy\u2019s very horribleness is part of what makes this novel so entertaining. He walks through the world in a haze of self-absorption, making mean-spirited observations about the people around him that are also quite funny.He had a long arrow-nose and almost no lips\u2014his mouth was just an unannounced slit in the final third of his face, like a muppet\u2019s. OrShe was flushed and fat and she wore a big, peasant style dress that looked as if it had been blown on to her by chance during a violent storm. He doesn\u2019t even spare himself from his own cruel wit.I have grown obsessed with my withering body\u2026My belly, oh God, my belly. I have noticed it swerving away, settling in a puddle of flesh at my side. In the mornings, I wake to find it lying next to me, gazing up at me, like an affectionate haggis. Willy\u2019s curmudgeonly rantings might get too one-note if it weren\u2019t for the novel\u2019s other protagonist: his deceased daughter Sadie. As Willy reads her journals, we see someone as shiny and innocent as he is jaded. In later entries, she begins making the series of choices that will lead up to her suicide, and the tension between Sadie\u2019s guileless optimism and the death that we know is coming gives the novel a lot of its momentum.Zoe Heller is a powerful writer with a gift for creating unsympathetic characters moving toward imperfect redemption. Everything You Know is her first novel, and while it lacks the depth of her later work--Notes on a Scandal and The Believers\u2014it\u2019s a highly enjoyable read. ",
            "Only when you die do you run out of chances to be good.Until then",
            "Willy Muller is a great character, the anti-hero at the diseased heart of Zo\u00eb Heller's debut novel. What makes the book so satisfying is not its originality; rather, it is the delicate and wickedly funny way that Heller makes her germophobic protagonist sympathetic even as the situation gets worse. Willy might have been gleefully played by Jack Nicholson in his prime. We cringe to watch him, but we peek through our fingers to see what he will do next. Also, we hope against hope that he might suddenly find redemption -- which he does, perhaps, in his own Willy way. Like Martin Amis, Heller's worldview is brilliantly scathing. You might not want to live there, but it's certainly worth the visit.",
            "Heller is a beautiful and very talented writer and story teller. And her ability to write such a complex main character, who\u2019s male, is exceptional. But despite that I struggled to completely enjoy the book as it\u2019s just so depressingly sad and the characters are not hugely likeable (that normally doesn\u2019t bother me) but the combination of the hopelessness and darkly sad characters makes it a book that I struggled to really enjoy. In saying that I read it in 24hrs. This however does not put me off reading the one other of her books I haven\u2019t read - The Believers - as she\u2019s an excellent writer!",

            "In asking for books with gender variant main characters, I was told to look up this alternate history book about a true hermaphrodite. Within the first five pages",
            "This book has a thing with telling rather than showing. Telling backstory, telling Ilario's thoughts (and everyone else's) on gender, the current political situation, people's plans--and in dialogue, not even in narration. It also has a thing with picking up and dropping plots somewhat at random.I wasn't a huge fan but I did like Ilario the character and a couple other characters. It had a cliffhanger so I'm tempted to read book 2 even tho I didn't like this one so much.",
            "Set in the same universe as Mary Gentle's Ash novels. In this one, she continues her recent trend of writing about gender-ambiguous protagonists with a protagonist who is an out-an-out hermaphrodite: the eponymous Ilario. Ilario's convincingly portrayed, seeming masculine at times and feminine at others without ever seeming inconsistently written. However, he/she is sometimes a difficult protagonist to like, being stubborn, impulsive, and more than a little self-centered. The secondary characters come off as rather saintly for putting up with him/her as much as they do. Ilario does ultimately come across as sympathetic, I think, but it's a near thing. Despite these faults, the book has two big things going for it. It's almost compulsively readable, with a gripping plot. And it has a fantastic cast of secondary characters, including a totally badass snarky Egyptian eunuch spymaster. I will put up with a lot in a book if it has a totally badass snarky Egyptian eunuch spymaster in it. Authors, take note. Anyone buying this book should be aware that this book isn't really a complete novel - Ilario was published as one large book in the UK, and split in two for its American publication. This volume ends on an cliffhanger, and you will want to get on to the next bit a.s.a.p. Probably best to buy both volumes together. ",
            "Brilliant",
            "Yikes.Ilario is a hermaphrodite; she/he wants to become a painter after being freed from slavery. Unfortunately, she/he immediately gets resold into slavery (from trusting the wrong person). We see a lot of similarly impulsive decisions: Ilario deciding to marry a girl in order to free her / bring her around the world (except the girl doesn't even want to be freed or leave her home). Ilario decides to go haring off after his/her mother that tried to kill her, and surprise - Ilario's mother still intends to kill Ilario. There's a lot of decisions that Ilario just doesn't think about without making, and that's frustrating, especially when we know that people are trying to kill Ilario.Despite this, Ilario manages to amass two friends: first, her/his biological father, Honorius, who swoops in with lots of fatherly love and second, Rekhmire', a castrato who repeatedly swoops in to save Ilario from their various scrapes. We're also supposed to be taken by Ilario's love of art and painting, which gains a greater focus in the second half of the novel. Unfortunately, I couldn't get over Ilario's poor decision making skills, which land this novel solidly in 1/5 stars.",
            "Lots of interesting themes here - too many, in fact. There was too much going on at the same time without enough explication. Rather than being a rich, meaty experience, the reader is subjected to thematic whiplash, and skating superficially over a whole bunch of interesting ideas without enough content. I wish I had loved this book; it's hard to find classical-themed science fiction. ",

            "Finished Ilario by Mary Gentle a couple of days ago.(Mary Gentle deserves much more love and internet presence, by the way, because she's a kickass writer)The novel is set in the early 15th century in the same universe as Ash; A Secret History, which is almost like ours, except that magic exists, Carthage was captured by Visigoths at some point, and was later cursed by a Rabbi, so that a huge black cloud called the Penitence covers the land, and the Mediterranean up to Malta. Out of necessity, Carthage has conquered a lot of land in order to grow food, and they have evolved a very strong kind of technology, or magitech, including incredibly strong stone golems that move to commands of their owners. The Turks have chucked the Egyptians out of Egypt at some point, and the latter have now settled in Constantinople, called Alexandria-in-exile, where the Pharao-Queen Ty-ameny rules with a tiny but strong hand. (she must be an ancestor of Harry Dresden's friend Murphy)Plot: the young hermaprodite Ilario flees from home (the court of a small Iberian kingdom), after almost having been killed by the own mother. (I see why the novel is written in first person, because otherwise you'd have to constantly come up with a fitting personal pronoun...) Ilario decides to travel to Rome to study under a famous master of a new style of art, and become a painter. On the way, s/he stops in Carthage in order to try some painting under the darkness of the Penitence. However, Ilario has barely made it through the city gates before being seduced by a guardsmen, and then poisoned by his mother, and sold into slavery. Fortunately, Ilario's new master, the Egyptian Rekhmire' (don't ask about the apostrophe...) is actually quite nice and understanding, and supports Ilario's ambitions, and they travel on to Rome, where Ilario manages to become an apprentice to Master...and that is only the beginning, as there will be more murderous relatives, slaves, a baby, Egyptians, mysterious visitors, golems, Etruscans, etc.I really quite liked this novel. The setting is close enough to reality to feel familiar (if you paid attention to your history classes), while being strange and exotic enough to make me want to know more about it. Ilario being an artist, and thus a very good observer, means that we get a lot of visual impressions about things, people and surroundings, which make the text very vivid and accessible.While one may argue that Ilario is a bit too successful although being rather naive and often rushing into things, there's enough lampshades hung on that to keep it out of Mary Stu territory. Rekhmire', for example, often responds to a harebrained plot by Ilario by saying that s/he should not trust his/her own decisions too much, as s/he spent most of his/her life being a slave and thus not able to take decisions. Ilario is incredibly lucky in finding a surrogate family to keep her/him out of trouble. Ilario does grow up to a certain extend in the course of the novel, although you still should get the Venetian glass out of reach if you're going to tell him/her something s/he's not going to like.While the plot is sometimes rather slow, (the time in Venice drags along a bit between assaults, sickrooms, and a veeery long labour), the characters are well-defined ans fleshed-out, the politicy are reasonably sound, and the setting is really fascinating, if you're that kind of geek. There's also a bunch of extra geek references, like the ghost ships, the book printer, and Onorata, who apparently will grow up to be a mercenary leader, and meet Ash about 20 years later.Another huge plus of the book is the humour. Pretty much everybody in this story is a deadpan snarker, which makes for nice reading and covers some plot weaknesses.All in all, a very entertaining and funny, but also serious (and often graphic) read with a stunning setting. 8.5/10"

            "GREED! Utter greed. People obsessed with what they could possibly inherit from old Dr Minoret. Always gossiping, scheming and plotting, and oh, when the old man finally dies, what a scramble to grab, grab, grab.In Balzac's La Com\u00e9die Humaine series this novel (#29*) is part of the section titled Scenes from Provincial Life, and a very provincial life is on display here. Every one knows exactly what everyone else is doing, and in particular what old Dr Minoret and his young ward, Ursule, are doing and saying. Their every word is analysed as everyone tries to guess what might happen next and who will inherit what.These appalling people and their small mindedness and malice are very well portrayed. But not all the characters in this novel are bad. The good old doctor and his friends the magistrate and the priest are all decent. And then of course there is Ursule herself who is a stark contrast to the other would-be legatees. If anything, Ursule is too saccharine. She is beautiful (blonde and blue-eyed of course!), clever, talented, loving, kind, generous, pious, etc. etc. She never puts a foot wrong. Whilst I prefer humans to be a little more... human, complete with human foibles, her contrasting character makes sense in this context. It serves to amplify the baseness of the other characters. The prospective legatees project all their own worst attributes on the innocent (young, beautiful, etc. etc.) Ursule. And just when you think that they have done their worst, their behaviour and evil intentions become worse. But in spite of all this ugliness there is a good deal of humour and irony. There is even an element of suspense as the reader waits to see whether Ursule will survive the graspers' onslaught and whether by any chance her tormentors get their comeuppance. Will (excessive) piety triumph over evil? Will love win the day?Balzac also injects an occult element into the tale. There is a chapter titled A Brief Digression on Magnetism followed by one titled A Double Conversion (both of which I found utterly silly) during which the atheist doctor re-evaluates his stance on the supernatural and religion (later in the novel there are more supernatural goings on). After reading these two chapters I nearly abandoned the novel, much as I like Balzac's writing. However, I persevered.#*I'm reading these novels and novellas out of chronological sequence as the mood takes me. The shorter works I'm reading in French and the longer ones in English.",

            "In the early pages of reading this I knew this is why I read Balzac. In those first chapters he presented his characters, set the scene and established the plot in prose at once readable and complex. I was a bit disconcerted, however, because everything seemed too good and too easy - so unlike Balzac. I need not have worried - as soon as I had those thoughts, Balzac turned the story inside out. Doctor Minoret's legal heirs couldn't trip over themselves quickly enough with their greed - and hate for Ursula - in acquiring wealth. Ursula is not his legal heir. The story is relatively short, and I can't tempt you any better than to say that much, and to say no more.This, together with Eug\u00e9nie Grandet, makes up Balzac's Scenes from Provincial Life. Eugenie Grandet - a full five stars - was my first Balzac. This is every bit as good. There are similarities as well as differences. I feel lucky to have found Balzac.",

Der Unterschied: die unscheinbare Eugenie erbt zwar mit 17 Millionen einen Riesensumme, wurde durch ihren geldgeilen Vater und dessen armselige Wirtschaft derart seelisch verkr\u00fcppelt und geistig eingeschr\u00e4nkt, dass sie immer ein armes, reiches M\u00e4dchen bleiben wird, weil sie mit der sp\u00e4ten Freiheit und den Reicht\u00fcmeren nichts anfangen kann, da ihr mit Mitte zwanzig jegliche Perspektive \u00fcber den kleinen Kreis hinaus fehlt.Die Waise Ursula, die Nichte des reichen Arztes Mirouet erh\u00e4lt dagegen von ihrem Onkel eine umfassende Ausbildung und bringt als Erbschaft das musikalische Talent ihrer Eltern und hat ein blendendes Aussehen und ein treues Herz, sie liebt den Nachbarssohn Savinien, ein im Schuldturm gestrandetes Mitglied der jeunesse d'or\u00e9e um Rastignac, de Trailles und Rubempr\u00e9.

Auch wenn die adelsstolze Mutter erst einmal die Liebesheirat verhindert und sp\u00e4ter von den gierigen Erben des Doktors ruiniert wird, Ursula und Savinien lieben einander aufrichtig und der verw\u00f6hnte Bengel wird auf dem zweiten Bildungsweg noch ein Held. Sp\u00e4ter heiratet der Vicomte auch die Tochter eines Bastards, in diesem Punkt gibt es keinen Spannungsmoment, das Liebesgl\u00fcck, vom dem eine Eug\u00e9nie Grandet nicht mal zu tr\u00e4umen wagt, ist nie durch Egoismen oder falschen Ehrgeiz bedroht, wohl aber von einer geldgeilen Verwandtschaft, deren Oberhaupt das Testament unterschl\u00e4gt und eine Rufmordkampagne gegen Ursula anzettelt, die das sensible M\u00e4dchen an den Rand des Grabes treibt. Die Rettung kommt aus dem Jenseits, Visionen und Tr\u00e4ume, in denen u.a. der Tote das Verbrechen aufkl\u00e4rt, spielen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Am Ende schl\u00e4gt auch die himmlische Gerechtigkeit gnadenlos zu, da der \u00dcbelt\u00e4ter nicht rechtzeitig bereut, geht die n\u00e4chste Generation zugrunde.Die \u00fcbersinnliche Ebene markiert einen weiteren signifikanten Unterschied zur gnadenlos realistischen Eugenie Grandet, deren magischen Erz\u00e4hlfluss Ursula leider nie erreicht. Der Roman um die Verbrechen der Verwandtschaft an einer unschuldigen Sch\u00f6nheit bleibt zu lange eine Aufeinanderfolge von Charakterportraits einer neidischen Kleinstadt und ist, f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack, am Ende zu linear-moralisch. Balzac ist besser, wenn die B\u00f6sen irgendwie davon kommen, auf wessen Kosten auch immer.",

            "Not exactly what I would have expected from one of the fathers of Realism. Ursule Mirouet is part of of Balzac's Scenes from a Provincial Life, and the story seemed, for about half of the book or more, to unfold predictably enough. A good as gold (and beautiful) girl raised by her benevolent (but aged) godfather in a small French town teaming with petty jealousies. It's the late 1820s, and the shadow of the Revolution and Napoleon still haunt the land. The godfather (and physician) was a part of those great events, and is now a rich man. He has returned to the town of his youth, and his relatives have eyes on a piece of the eventual inheritance, which the doctor would prefer to bestow upon his beloved goddaughter, Ursule. As is the case with a Balzac novel, you have the great physical descriptions, colorful characters, and vicious intrigues. But as I said above, about at the half way point things get weird: magnetism (as a movement in France), second sight, a ghost, prophecy, and a bit of gothic gore, flip this story around. It makes for an uneven but still interesting read. I suppose one could read the weirdness as a part of Provincial life. I think Faulkner would agree."

        "description": "People of European descent form the bulk of the population in most of the temperate zones of the world--North America, Australia and New Zealand. The military successes of European imperialism are easy to explain because in many cases they were achieved by using firearms against spears. Alfred Crosby, however, explains that the Europeans' displacement and replacement of the native peoples in the temperate zones was more a matter of biology than of military conquest. Now in a new edition with a new preface, Crosby revisits his classic work and again evaluates the ecological reasons for European expansion. Alfred W. Crosby is the author of the widely popular and ground-breaking books, The Measure of Reality (Cambridge, 1996), and America's Forgotten Pandemic (Cambridge, 1990). His books have received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Prize, the Medical Writers Association Prize and been named by the Los Angeles Times as among the best books of the year. He taught at the University of Texas, Austin for over 20 years. First Edition Hb (1986): 0-521-32009-7 First Edition Pb (1987): 0-521-33613-9",

            "This book sounds/looks amazing, and I was so excited to finally get around to it (it's been sitting on my shelves for a few years). Alas, it turned out to be a non-critical, awfully confused hodge-podge of random strands from various disciplines (ecology, history, anthropology, geography) strung loosely together into a knotted mess that made it clear that Crosby does not have adequate knowledge in ANY field, certainly not enough to write such an important work.Crosby engages in such tactics as quoting scripture to explicate historical events, making wild claims, i.e. nothing major happened between the domestication of horses ~5k years ago and the imperialism instigated by Europe in the 1000s,without offering any evidence or support for this claim (I wonder if Biblical, Greek, Sumerian, African, Chinese, etc etc historians would agree?), and frequently guessing or approximating major evolutionarily important dates. A glaring flaw of his work is that it is EXTREMELY NON-RIGOROUS (despite the citations",
            "This classic of biogeography has been on my to-read list for a few years (I'm not sure where I got the rec from - possibly Against the Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization?). I was under the impression it was a narrower and less fully formed iteration of Jared Diamond's ideas in Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. There is a lot of overlap between the two, especially in the epidemiological arena (really an older idea than either of them, and Crosby goes so far as to name it William Hardy McNeill's Law)",
            "An idea that sounds neater than it actually plays out in the book, which one can only fault the author for. This largely comes down to what could be called a jittery approach to the subject. When Crosby firms up and sticks to the titular material, the book is fairly interesting: some sections that stand out is the whole chapter on weeds (an amorphous and amusing designation as he rightly points out) or the intrusion of Old World fauna on New World areas (rabbits, pigs). To me, this is the meat of the book, but Crosby doesn't take it far enough. Instead, he interlopes on his own theme by having a whole chapter about winds and navigation which doesn't sit right on the subject's stomach. He also dwells, for my tastes, far too long on disease, which is perhaps the one obvious, over-studied facet of this entire topic. It detracts from the overall work, but only slightly.Some other reviews seem to disdain his use of clever Biblical scripture, but I think it should be made clear that he merely quotes those things in a churlish, chuckly sort of way, as cultural backdrop to the topic. He quotes Shakespeare, Lyell, and others openly, too. A cursory flip-through of the notes/bibliography shows a wide depth of scholarly invocation.Also absent, thankfully, is any kind of sultry, academic jargon. He makes clear the repugnance of what happened over the centuries, especially to the folks involved, without delving into the kind of seedy preaching that seems to dominate histories of the European irruption into the world.",
            "Walking around with this book made me feel like yet another Berkleyan post-hippy fuming over my unresolved anger and guilt over yet another heinous crime perpetrated by my European cultural forebears: they didn't just enslave Africans, they didn't just exterminate all the Amerindians, but by Gaia, their very ecosystem took over the world! WTF, Columbus?! Where did it end?To clarify, I am not that guy (well, mostly), and this is not that book (ditto), despite the title. This book is another exploration of the foundations of European success in the rest of the world, particularly in areas where European descendants (genetic and cultural) now dominate (US, Canada, Australia, NZ, Argentina). I believe what made Crosby's work novel in the 1980s was that he didn't confine his analysis to European humans, but also pointed out that European plants, animals, and disease organisms were equally successful in colonizing the temperate world.Aside from my usual qualms with history (not empirical, often based on scanty evidence, prone to digression, etc) I thought this was pretty good, but being somewhat familiar with some of those who followed in Crosby's footsteps (Diamond, Cronon, Mann), there wasn't too much novelty, and I thought his failure to address the importance of American food crops (maize, potatoes, chilies, tomatoes) to non-American culture and sustenance did some damage to his argument. Frankly the more I read these kinds of books the more I respect the wide scope of Charles Mann's work, despite its failings. I did enjoy Crosby's approach of analyzing failed European colonizations (Norse in North American, the Crusades, British Raj) and of their earliest successful efforts on Atlantic islands like Madeira and the Azores (where they also encountered Neolithic peoples that they had trouble subduing before their diseases took hold). If you believe historians like Crosby, it's remarkable how many large patterns in human migration seem to be predicated on disease.Some NotesThe ancient Sumerians worshipped a god (or goddess) of pests named Ninkilim (p. 29). I want to believe Wikipedia's description of her/him as the lord of teeming creatures is accurate because it is beautiful and gross and reminds of Annie Dillard's chapter on fecundity in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.Hafvilla is an Old Norse word meaning a complete loss of direction at sea (p. 55). Aside from being ripe with metaphoric potential",
            "Crosby is a great writer and he has intriguing things to say. However, he is incredibly Eurocentric and Christian biased. It can grow tiring hearing how great Europeans are compared to the ethnic groups they conquered (often brought up with belittling and/or unflattering terms). Shame, really, because it totally undermines what could have been a splendid little history of the European conquest of the rest of the world. I recommend at least perusing the book if you're interested in the subject, but be aware that this is a very ethnocentric view on the topic. ",
            " Credit where credit is due: Crosby writes with humor and flourish, and the realization that we're the baddies on a horrifying scale must have been a tough pill to swallow in 1986. Thankfully"

        "description": "Summers are always stifling in southern Virginia, and they're even hotter on the Mecklenburg Correctional Center's Death Row when Dennis Stockton arrives there in July 1983. Charged with murder for hire, Stockton insisted he was innocent, but his jury sentenced him to die. In prison, he begins keeping a diary and it soon becomes his lifeline, nurturing dreams of freedom and publication as an author.Mecklenburg's officials had always prided themselves on running a secure prison, but that left them vulnerable to an ingenious escape conspiracy. Though indispensable in the plotting, Stockton decides not to run, betting instead on a new trial and exoneration. The escape of the \"Mecklenburg Six\" is dazzlingly suspenseful, as they take hostages, don guards' uniforms, and, staging a monumental bluff, make history with America's first mass escape from Death Row. Mean-while, Stockton notes it all in his journal.After the escape, a Norfolk newspaper editor, William F. Burke, Jr., writes to the remaining inmates, seeking information on the unprecedented breakout. Stockton's diary becomes the most revealing account, and when excerpts are published, a scandalous portrait of Death Row emerges: bribed guards, marijuana plants, homebrew alcohol, weapon stashes, unlocked cell doors, and jailhouse sex. Overnight, Stockton becomes the most hated man in Virginia's prisons for his expos\u00e9. During the next eleven years, he survives plots against his life and endures subhuman conditions. Throughout his ordeal he struggles to find his voice as a writer, while battling to gain a new trial and escape the \"monster factory,\" his name for Death Row. As Stockton's scheduled execution nears, the case against him begins unraveling, leaving readers to ponder the true nature of justice.",

Nigga",
            "Overall Rating: 666 (the equivalent of an A+)Synopsis: Black Metal, by Rick Spears and Chuck BB, follows twin brothers, Shawn and Sam, who are a little...different from the other kids. To start with, these brothers are totally brutal, and are seriously metal. Their favorite band is Frost Axe, and their parentage is mysterious to say the least - though their foster mother is hilariously normal. Soon we learn that they may be the reincarnation of the demon Roth, and they have to fulfill the dark and totally grim prophecy of the Hell Baron.Ok, so Black Metal may not be manga in the strictest sense, but that all depends on your definition of manga. That's a discussion for another day, but I will say that Black Metal is definitely manga sized if nothing else. So, I'm reviewing it, and there's not much you can do about it. Except go out and buy the book, because it's bad ass. I picked up the first volume of the series at Comic Con this year, and I knew it was going to be good, because I got a free guitar pick of someone throwing the horns. I read it all that night, and then ran into Rick and Chuck at the con the next day. The book kicked ass and the guys were awesome. I bought a totally grim poster from them, and they gave me a cd by Satyricon. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the boys' foster mother takes them shopping for school clothes. Looking around the store, they comment that this store is ripe for the apocalypse. If you've ever been the weird kid",

            "This was quite the read. It had everything, from hilarious lines, gut wrenching coming of age panels, and epic battles against demons. Black Metal is quite an impressive read. Everything comes by so fast that you won't even notice you're at the end. The storytelling came off brilliantly, really. It's a graphic novel you'd find hard to put down as you read it. It remains true to its inspirations up to the dialogues that our characters use. It's really evil. Truly evil. Hahah. Oh and the illustrations were great! Like in the most evil sense of the word great. It's brilliant and clearly depicted. The cartoonish take of it all makes the whole mindwarping evil plot ironic, and that's exactly why I love it!!!Here we get a story about the twins Sam and Shawn, who basically feels bored with mundane things. After listening to a black metal record they purchased at a public mall. They've come to the realization that they are descendants of some great demon hero, Roth. From then on, they start a wild journey to the underworld and battled every one that were against them in reclaiming their rightful throne. It's a fun epic adventure that is truly evil and metal and black on all proportions. I cannot wait to get started on the next volume. It's a very good read. It's a fun read. I'd gladly recommend this to everyone.",
            "This book seems to want to be taken super seriously, which is really hard to do with the art style. Two very metal teens (don't call them Goth) start off getting kicked out of school (again), and end up chasing a legendary sword and taking on the legions of hell. Destinies come forth, epic battles against raging demons, it all feels like a heavy metal cover come to life, but the artwork is black and white and so cartoonish that it can never really get over the disconnect between content and style. Some of it is played for laughs, but it just feels very inconsistent in tone and content. Granted I'm not into heavy metal, so I'm not the target audience, but I can't see myself moving on to the next volume to see where it goes. It ends in a good enough place here, and there's nothing inspiring enough to continue on.",
            "Good parts:- Easy read- Very brilliantly illustratedBad parts:- Too short (but then again, graphic novels tend to be more about the graphics than the stories)- A little too dramatic of a story-- way over-exaggeratedHad this novel been longer, I probably wouldn't have liked it. Then again, it was way too short for me to buy them very often (read in less than a day); at $10-$12 each, it would be quite expensive for me to keep buying them. I may get the second book, just for something different to read (break up monotony).",
            "more metal than a metal sword (there's only one person i know who will understand that joke, and he's probably not on goodreads).in any case, this is one of those scott pilgrim books where things seem fairly normal until they take a massive left turn into oncoming traffic. who would have known that a couple of metalhead brothers would actually be the reincarnation of an ancient god, sent to destroy satan and discover magic and monsters in suburbia?i should also add that reading this before i began playing d&d was a fantastic idea."

Megan is a very naive, hometown girl with a great talent that she hasn't shared with many people. Katch is a rich worldly man that is used to getting what he wants and he wants Megan and Megan's grandfathers amusement park. They are from two completely different worlds but now their worlds have collided.",
            "Was a good love story. It was a thin book I was able to read without taking up a lot of time. The book wasn't crazy amazing or anything, but still a cute love story.",
            " According to \u201cLess of a Stranger\u201d by Nora Roberts, love and trust are two of the biggest issues in a relationship. Without these two, a relationship will not work out right. The story was sweet. The characters felt like real people. Less of a stranger takes place in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Nora Roberts captures the charm of the people and the place in this book. I was very impressed with the wonderful detail of the beach. Then again, Roberts is extremely descriptive and can form a picture in the mind of even the most unimaginative reader. You can hear the sounds of the ocean and the theme park, taste the lobster and wine, and experience what the characters experience. The protagonist of the book Megan Miller, a 23 years old woman, spends her days helping her grandfather run Joyland, the family\u2019s amusement park. When she\u2019s not working there, in her spare time she enjoys creating beautiful sculptures. One day Megan meets a handsome and charismatic man named David Katcherton, also known as Katch, at a local market. She was attracted to the good-looking flirt. When Katch invites her out to dinner Megan turns him down flat when she considers him too careless. Later that evening he returns to talk to her grandfather. Katch is willing to pay a large amount of money to buy Joyland but Megan is against that offer. As they begin to spend more time together, Katch discovers that Megan is a talented artist. When her grandfather informs her that he has sold Joyland to Katch, Megan is furious beyond words. She cannot help but feels that Katch has been pursuing her only to get his hands on Joyland. She cannot believe that she allowed herself to fall in love with this man. Will Katch be able to convince Megan his feelings are for real? Katch is wealthy, handsome business man who goes after and gets whatever he wants. This time, he sets his sights on Joyland and of course, Megan. Well this time it is going to be really hard for him to convince Megan of his feelings for her. Megan, however, is sentimental and does not want to let go of the park. Once Katch sweeps her off her feet, Megan thinks that he did it just to get control of the park and she loses trust in him. If it were me I would also not trust him anymore and I would think that he was just using me to get what he wanted, my grandfather\u2019s property. Well Megan soon finds out that Katch\u2019s intentions for her are for real. But how did this man convince her that his love for her was for real? You would have to read the book to find out. We never really get to know Katch and how he thinks. There is a little twist behind this character. We never get into the minds of anyone beside Megan and I dislike that. We know that Megan has trust issues, but things will ameliorate between her and Katch as he challenged her to fulfill her dreams. This was the first book I read by Nora Roberts, and I picked it up totally by chance. But I am glad I did because overall it is a good book and I liked it, although I did not like everything about it. One thing that I like about Roberts story is that you can picture it in your mind. If you have never read one of her book before, \u201cLess of a Stranger\u201d is a good place to start.",
            "Some of these early Nora Roberts books are completely awful. I'm supposed to think that a guy who creeps about and stalks a woman in the grocery store and crosses physical boundaries like touching and kissing without any hint from the woman that it's okay, is romantic? He (the Hero Katch) is arrogant and bent on owning everything...including the heroine. He doesn't even know her and he tells himself that he will have her - it's as though he's saving up for a new car or something. And I'm sorry, but how is We both know if I'd been a little more persuasive tonight",
            "This book was okay, but definitely not the best one I've read by NR. It's dated, which didn't really bother me. It had a lot of potential but since back in the days of Silhouette the books tended to be a lot shorter and it shows.The book centers around Katch and Megan. I wasn't really fond of either character. Katch is extremely rich and extremely arrogant. He's a tease and somewhat manipulative and tries to take control of her life. Megan is very mistrusting, which I understood, but then she is suddenly okay with the guy. Then she flip flops on those two stands. They fall in love within like two weeks. So it puts them having met each other, engaged within 3 weeks. Married 3 days later. Met and married within a month? I mean, come on. Not believable. Very rushed. And again, I don't get what either of them loved so much about the other. So it wasn't very believable and it was really cheesy sometimes. Good for some light reading at the beach or something quick and romancey.Two stars. It was quick and enjoyable and got me to 52 books for the year. Read it within eight hours, with a lot of not-reading in between.",
            "De facto est\u00e1 me a custar um pouco n\u00e3o dar mais estrelinhas, mas a historia que NR nos apresenta n\u00e3o tem o conte\u00fado nem a profundidade de sentimentos, de emo\u00e7\u00e3o a que nos habituou nos anos precedentes.Nota-se que a historia j\u00e1 foi escrita h\u00e1 uns bons anos atr\u00e1s e dai que algumas das cenas n\u00e3o sejam descritas com envolv\u00eancia, com o carisma, com o deslumbramento que tive ao ler outros romance mais recente da NR.Mas apesar de tudo n\u00e3o deixa de ser uma historia apraz\u00edvel, de leitura r\u00e1pida e sem grandes pretens\u00f5es que n\u00e3o seja o de entretenimento.",
            "This was a read, that felt rushed and formulated. Before reading about two people falling in love, I expect them to first bring something to the picnic or, at the very least, reveal that they are damaged. This was the age old writing mistake of telling instead of showing. We are TOLD of the male romantic interest's redeeming traits, but he is SHOWN as a stalking, arrogant, perve, who likes toying with the emotions of desperate people. Then, again we are told that he is a priestly and virtuous philanthropist, but we are shown that, behind her back, he goes after whatever he wants. It just didn't work for me. Plus she and her grandfather should have developed expert people skills by running a seasonal business. Again, the telling and showing of these characters is at odds. I kept waiting for her to kick him in the tender spot and for her grandfather to send out a few Carnies with a different kind of contract. The plot line is the reason this book received two stars. With a better timeline and better fleshing out of the characters, this book could have been a fun read. Instead, it read like an afternoon dictation to me. I do not recommend this book. ",
            "Megans parents died when she was 5 years old, so she was raised by her grandfather. He owned an amusement park and Megan helped him run it. She likes to dabble in sculpting on the side but doesnt think of selling her pieces. she is content in helping her grandfather run the park.Then she meets a guy at the grocery store who is an egomaniac. He doesnt like the word NO. He pursues Megan even when she tells him she isnt interested. He is even bold enough to tell her that he WILL have her AND her Grandfathers amusement park before the season opens. { 4-6 weeks}Katch was a bit to full of himself and bossy and pushy for my taste. I would have never dated him, he was borderline abusive in my opinion.Megan was a pushover with Katch at times, she wouldnt stand her ground and let him have control over every aspect of their relationship.The story was easy flowing and a fast read...held my interest all the way through",

            "The 1980's no-means-yes mentality was alive and well in this book, as it was in pretty much all romance novels back then. Irritating, but that was a different time. Though the world loves to judge, you can't measure 1984 behavior with a 2020 yardstick. Apart from that, this book was fantastic. I absolutely loved the setting, the beach amusement park, and the main characters (though completely old school romance characters) were charming in their own way. The woman, a closet artist doing brilliant work in the park off-season, the man, a gallivanting, independently wealthy playboy finally meeting the one woman who can tame him. Not only do they find love but they also actualize all their other dreams as well.",
            "This is another romance that develops quite fast and then goes sour. David K. sees her and simply must meet her and Megan wants nothing to do with him. But he comes to talk with her Grandfather that she lives with, and boom, romance develops. He just happens to be very, very rich of course and he buys some of her sculptures and her career is blooms. She hates to leave her grandfather and the carnival he owns, even for a couple of months, but does and gets back with David.",
            "Not every book can be a good book. This was one of the not so good books. Katch (what a terrible choice for a name) is very aggressive in his approach towards Megan. He forced her into positions where she could not refuse but to be with him. All the while, her Pop is egging Katch on. Katch is arrogant and far too into himself. Megan tries to push him off and continuously tells him she's not interested. Yet, somehow, he twists himself into her heart.",
            "Wonderful,beautiful story. T thank you Nora for writing such a beautiful heartfelt love story. I'm a born romantic but sometimes get tired of reading such sexual explicit stories. This was so beautiful and so lovingly tender and what a joy in all these tumultuous times. Always enjoy your books but this one more than ever.",
            "Megan and her grandfather own and manage an amusement park, Katch wants to buy it. That is not all he wants. Had it not been a day of downpours, kept inside the campervan, the time of day would have been spent otherwise - it did however pass not unpleasantly but very predictably. Enough Nora Roberts for some time.",

            "Mommy's review from 8/8/10 - This was Julia's first chapter book! She liked it enough that I'm getting the other books in the series. I think it may be a little beyond her actual age group but she's getting more into reading lately and she did fine with it. It'd written in a way that it's easy for the child to remember where they left off. We usually read one or two chapters at a time and I was surprised when she remembered what was happening each time we picked it back up - I was worried about this. Another thing I worried about, probably obviously, was the lack of pictures. This is the first totally non-illustrated book and while I was hoping got good results I knew I may have to wait awhile to get back to this one. Julia did mind the fact that there are no pictures here at all and I think it's because the story itself really kept her going. The characters are all relatable to a child, even as young as Julia at almost 5, and I think all kids can relate to wanting a puppy, even Julia who has a plethora of animals. Can't wait to read the rest with her! If anyone has an recommendations about any book(s) like these for a young child I'd love to hear them - especially if they're about dinosaurs, unicorns, or ponies! :)"

            "This is one of those expatriot memoirs where an American or Brit pulls up stakes to live la bella vita--or the simpler life--in some warm clime. Think Frances Mayes' Under the Tuscan Sun or Peter Mayle\u2019s A Year in Provence, usually told oh so lyrically, eruditely, with lots of literary allusions and mentions of mouth-watering cuisine. I\u2019ve been reading through a recommendation list of such travel writing--this was the last--and I suppose my reaction to this one might be put down to having become rather jaded and cranky reading one after another. The blurbs of reviews inside claim Cohan is a better, more gifted writer than you usually see in these travelogues, and call his prose \u201cvivid,\u201d \u201celegant,\u201d \u201cpoetic\u201d and the inevitable, \u201clyrical.\u201d It boasts the present tense that is the insignia of the literati, rather choppy prose given lots of sentence fragments and short, declarative sentences, and sports such lines as: \u201cDew drops quiver on the spiky tips of barrel cacti in the glimmering dawn.\u201d I\u2019m afraid reading I often felt suffocated by perfume. The style was possibly my biggest problem with this book--far, far too flowery for my tastes. There also was something about Cohan\u2019s sensibility that grated on me. There often is an implied insult to expatriot tales if you\u2019re from the country fled from, but in that respect this was the worst among the dozen or so I have read. I took umbrage at the description of New York City, and particularly the Columbia University area, which I know well. He claimed his daughter lived in an apartment on 110th Street infested with \u201crats and roaches.\u201d (Rats? Mice and roaches I\u2019d believe--was she living in a crack house?) And the neighborhood was filled with \u201cBums and muggers, rappers and dopeheads.\u201d A lot more dire than I\u2019d describe it, and given the exaggeration about a place I know well, I suspected Cohan felt he had to trash America in order to paint Mexico in this much more idyllic light. It\u2019s a subtle distinction perhaps, but I remember Mayes, for instance, as showing Italy\u2019s appeal without sounding like she felt a need to feel superior to America and its \u201cconsumerism\u201d and yet at the same time with Cohan there\u2019s a patronizing streak towards Mexico evident to me at times.Yet I continued reading beyond the 100-page mark, because I found interesting reading a description of Mexico. It\u2019s a country Americans should know and understand better than we do, and Cohan did weave in bits of in the history and culture of the land he\u2019s residing in, even if I never felt he quite left the lifestyle and mindset of a tourist. And if I sometimes felt he romanticized life in a third world country, at least he wasn\u2019t completely unaware of his privileged status. But if I had to describe in one word the way Cohan came across to me, it would be: smug.",
            "This definitely ranks as one of the best travel writing/memoirs I've ever read. Cohan describes how he and his wife left LA for life in San Miguel de Allende and all they experienced there between 1985 and 1999. Published in 2001, and finally read by me in 2017, this is not only an account of another country, but also of another time. I was captivated by his descriptions of the place and daily life, with all of its travails, but also by the fact that it happened pre-iPhone and internet. They had to make long distance calls from the largo distancia office, and when they finally had a landline, they had to borrow someone's phone. He captures Mexico pre-NAFTA, before globalization, and before the world became so homogenized. It is very poignant. While he writes lavish descriptions of the landscapes, fiestas, and food, he also does not shy away from the very problems of living in a third world country and its effects on those who live there. This is a very moving account of what it's like to live overseas. Highly recommend.",
            "So what is it like to chuck it all and go live in a country with a language and culture foreign to you? This book gives you an idea. It is romantic",
            "The smugness quotient was pretty high at certain points, but I appreciated his atmospheric descriptions of the sights and sounds of daily life in San Miguel. ",
            "Wonderful story, well-written. Loved it.",
            "as if I needed one more white male's perspective. I made it as far as i did through this book because I am soon visiting this city, and have been feeling inspired to know all there is to know about my destination. but perhaps I'll tell my own tales. or better yet, keep my ears open and listen to the stories of the locals.",
            "San Miguel Allende used to be a beautiful little town and still is, to a far lesser extent, despite its huge sports utility vehicles with license plates from the United States and its now super-expensive hotels and villas. While the book is interesting, I have lived in Mexico City and have traveled throughout the country and learned a few things.After 2 years there, I grew incredibly bored, as I am a native New Yorker who is fascinated by hoardes of international immigrant groups. If being sized-up like you are an alien from outer space upon speaking highly accented Spanish is up your alley, you certainly wouldn't detect it from this book. In addition, Cohan, like all too many expatriots, it seems, is trying desperately not only to romanticize the unromantic, but to prove a point to his native countrypeople about how much more accepting he is of adversity and the like than is the typical, so-called provincial, North American. The fact that all too many mere movements are nightmarish ordeals and that one is voluntarily subjecting oneself to such a predicament is nothing to boast about. At least Mary Morris' book about residing in Mexico was too the point and not so Pollyannaish. Cohan's perceptions of being stuck in time or stuck in a time warp are perceptive indeed, though.Likewise, although it is still relatively economical to reside even in San Miguel Allende as compared to, say, L.A., it is far different for a man of means such as Coban than it would be for a virtually penniless young person visiting Mexico to, say, teach English. Conclusively, it almost sounded as if Coban had brainwashed himself into thinking that this troubled nation was, instead, an utter paradise, which would question me to wonder whether or not he and his wife are masochistic to a certain extent."

However, since one of the things this website is dedicated to is honest artistic criticism, I also feel it's important to acknowledge books that I found just too bad to bother finishing, as well as give you an idea of why I found them that bad to begin with. Hence, this series of short essays.)The Accused: The Traveler, by John Twelve Hawks (pseudonym)How far I got: 24 pages. Yeah",
            "THE TRAVELER BY JOHN TWELVE HAWKS: This book actually generated quite a bit of buzz before it was released last June and I had it recommended to me by a few people saying that it was in the vein of Stephen King, and since I'm a fan I would probably enjoy this. I managed to get an ARC through the bookstore I used to work at and then it sat on my shelf for about six months until I picked it up and decided to start reading it last week. I finished it about four days later after pretty much eating it up. I would describe it as very akin to a Michael Crichton techno-thriller with some plenty of sci-fi mixed in. After getting about a hundred pages into it I was even wondering if Crichton much just be working on this same book currently because of its similarities with his story lines, the main difference being that this was a little slower and the characters had more depth to them. After finished this book I realize that this has certain elements that Crichton would never put in his book make this an enjoyable original piece of fiction. If the Matrix trilogy had originally been made into a book trilogy and done by a good writer, it would've been something like The Traveler.The book is set near to the present day or perhaps twenty or thirty years into the future. The world is pretty much like it is now, except for being a little more high-tech and with better gadgets. There is a group of people known as Travelers who have the unique ability of being able to leave their bodies and travel to other worlds or realms. They have existed for many thousands of years, Jesus and Mohammed are though to have been travelers. There is a group of people known as the Tabula whose job it is to eradicate these travelers by whatever means necessary. They have also been in existence for a long time. Then there is a group called the Harlequins whose job it is to project the Travelers by whatever means necessary; again they have been around for a very long time.In the present it is thought that no travelers are in existence anymore, having been wiped out by the Tabula, while the Harlequins have been reduced to very small numbers. Our main character is the daughter of a Harlequin whose father is soon killed in the book and while she had renounced her duty as a Harlequin, due to the lack of these people remaining, she has been summoned to become a Harlequin once more, because two offspring of a traveler have been found alive in California. The traveler's gift is usually passed down through genes, though this is not certain. It is her job to find those two brothers and keep them safe. The Tabula also know of the existence of these two brothers, but their modus operandi has changed dramatically. They no longer wish to kill the Travelers, but to harness their powers. The reason being that using past Travelers they have been in contact with another race living in one of the other realms that the Travelers go to, and this race is vastly superior and more intelligent and has been sending them new inventions and technology such as creating quantum computers that can measure how Travelers pass into these other realms as well as being able to send additional matter into these realms. So they want to use the Travelers as guinea pigs to work with this new race.This the setting of the book with a lot more details than I have given and features great chase scenes and amazing fights. The Harlequins are taught from when they are children how to fight with different weapons. At the same time the Tabula basically have the Internet, all technology, the government, police, etc. under their control. If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter.",
            "This book was not at all what I expected...but I loved it. I am not generally a big sci-fi/alternate reality fan but loved this read.The author raised tons of important points regarding big brother and how easily our every move can be monitored by the vast machine. I am not an alarmist but it is a little scary how easily our movements could be traced through seemingly little things such as grocery store discount cards and security cameras in ATM's. I loved Maya's character the female harlequin wrestling with emotion and destiny. Is her future necesarily bound by the harlequin tradition or is she free to pursue friendships.Being a theologian at heart I was fascinated by the books take on religion. It basicaly describes the religious experience as being a result of measurable brain activity. They joke about the God in the box and the idea that God is all in our head",
            "Conspiracy with paranormal twist, great!",
            "What it is: In the not too distant future, a vaguely dystopic America has only one chance to be saved from the peril of implanted microchips and spliced rat/dog mutants--the Traveler, a man capable of traveling through the fabric of alternate realities and bringing back capital-T Truths to set the world free. Gabriel, this generation's Traveler (previous Travelers have included Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha... you get the pat drift), is not so much a reluctant hero as a poseable doll. Protected by his bodyguard, an oddly-named Harlequin whose family has protected Travelers for generations",

        "description": "The Boston Red Sox?s loss to the New York Yankees in the final game of last year?s playoffs has been called ?the game of the century,? evidence that the rivalry between the Red Sox and the Yankees is hotter than ever. In the wake of that defeat, author and Boston Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy has updated his bewitching story of the curse that has lain over the Red Sox since they sold Babe Ruth to the hated Yankees in 1920. Here he sheds light on classic Sox debacles?from Johnny Pesky?s so- called hesitation throw, to the horrifying dribbler that slithered between Bill Buckner?s legs, to last year?s stunning extra-inning home run that kept the Sox without a World Championship for yet another year. Lively and filled with anecdotes, this is baseball folklore at its best.",

            "Shaughnessy is a Hall of Fame baseball writer. He is also a curmudgeon with a pen. The coiner of the Olde Towne Team phrase has made a healthy living off of schadenfreude.Since its initial publication in 1990",
            "This was a pretty good book, though outdated, about the history of the Boston Red Sox.The Sox have a history of not being able to finish what they started, (at least up until 2004), and this book explores their failures. Blaming the issues on the sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1919 by Harry Frazee, (though there is no record of Ruth actually cursing the Sox), the book explores in detail the following painful experiences of Red Sox fans that have been attributed to the Curse of the Bambino:-\t1946: Johnny Pesky \u201chesitates\u201d and gets thrown out, causing the Sox to lose the 1946 World Series in 7 games.-\t1949: Leading by 1 game, the Sox goes into Yankee Stadium for essentially a playoff series and losing both games and the \u201949 Pennant.-\t1967: The dream team, with the only negative point being that they did not win the World Series. -\t1975: After Fisk\u2019s game 6 walk-off home run, the Sox were unable to win game 7, and lost the series to the Reds.-\t1986: 1 strike away from winning the World Series in game 6, the sox lost the game, and even with a 3 \u2013 0 lead in game 7 lost the series. Red Sox fans blamed Billy Buckner until 2004 for this as the ball did go through his legs. Yet none of these \u201cknowledgeable\u201d fans seemed to remember it was not Buckner that allowed the 2 out hits, (Schirladi) or that Buckner did not throw the wild pitch to allow the tying run to score, (Stanley). -\t1999: The Sox were not able to get past the Yankees in the ALCS.-\t2003: Aaron Boone off Tim Wakefield.The book stops with Spring Training of 2004, and so does not explore the breaking of the curse. I do think that it would be a good addition for the author to write a chapter on 2004 as it would be a perfect closure to the story, especially how dramatically the Sox came back in the ALCS to beat the Yankees and eventually to win the World Series for the first time since 1918.This was a good book for any baseball fan to read. Though I am a Yankee fan, I appreciate the history behind such a great franchise as our arch rivals. Again, I think the author should write an additional chapter to cover 2001 through 2018 as they would be a great finish to the story. I would recommend this book to all baseball fans, and especially Red Sox fans.",
            "60 - 70% of this book is literally just play by play of games lost and bad deals throughout the years. The first three chapters were entertaining. After than it just gets incredibly repetitive. Seems like it would have been better as a few column article in the Boston Globe rather than a book. ",
            "Ironically read this right as the Red Sox were in the midst of breaking the Curse. What timing it was! Loved this full-detailed explanation of Babe Ruth and his legacy from the eyes of Boston fans. ",
            "wierd, when i read it, i was in hs and obsessed with reading shaughnessy and ryan and gammons anything written in the globe. i studied the sunday section and anything they wrote i ate up. i still remember the book details that through some convuluted way the sox should/could have had mays. not sure how realistic but book makes it seem like it was a done-deal. now after reading sports guy for like 5 years",
            "Now a historical curiosity, this book accurately captures what it was like for Red Sox fans to almost win but not quite for 86 years and to anticipate what ways their beloved Sox would find to snatch defeat from the Jaws of victory. In the first 106 years of the World Series only 1 team got to within a strike of winning the world series and failed to win it, the 1986 Red Sox.",
            "It's a must read for every Red Sox fan, and also for anyone who loves a Red Sox fan. It explains why eventhough we're in the playoffs, we're still not excited about it."

            "This book was a birthday present from my parents. A good read, and every Aussie should read up a bit about Monash, he was one of those giants of our history. There are two reasons this book doesn't score higher. Firstly, it is not well edited and can be confusing in places and sometimes simple things are wrong, such as the rank of characters in the book being wrong in the timeline, and other simple mistakes. More importantly though, the book is very one eyed about Monash. There were other leaders on the Western Front that were also starting to fight a different war and who had learned from the hard years in the trenches. The Canadian, New Zealand and English at least all had leaders that did well at the same time as Monash. Having said that, I take nothing away from Monash and highly recommend this book.",
            "Listened on audio. This was written in such an interesting way it kept my attention through a mammoth 21 cds! Went into lots of detail from his boyhood to his death. An incredible achiever.",
            "Too Long, Too boring. That's how I will sum this book up. It's vey hard to get through a book like this that is so pedestrian. It's a shame, because he is a great, if not one of the greatest, modern Australians.",
            "Wonderful in every way. Thoroughly researched, as always, with Roland Perry. Found out many things I did not know and was totally engaged throughout the book. Was a terrific depiction of the times and nothing has really changed. Power of the press and politics. ",

            "Brilliant account of one of the finest Australians to have lived.",
            "Captivating read that I couldn't put down. Made me very proud to be an Australian, and I'm not even Australian!",
            "Listened to this as an audio book as I walked around the oval daily. 'Going for a date with Sir John Monash'....was how I described it. Very impressed by the biographer Roland Perry's crafting of the meticulously strategic personality of the man Monash. Amused that his aim at one stage was to become a chancellor of Melbourne University. And so many of us have been to a university named after him; Monash University. Or live in a council named after him. On a day to day basis, he might have been annoyingly pedantic, but his engineering ideas were significant in building bridges, railways , military strategies and in problem solving techniques. Glad to know a little more about him as an innovator who kept trying despite various prejudices against him. Admired his persistent learning but his list of what he required in a wife was most telling.",
            "Too often we read about the British generals in the Great War. Wilson, Gough, Haig and Rawlinson et alia. Enter centre stage an Australian militia trained Engineer-lawyer soldier. Haig said that Monash arrived too late and if he had been on the scene in 1915, the war could very well have been shortened. Monash's engineering skills planed all assaults down the details and gave all his commanders instructions. On of his battles was over in the length of time to see a movie.The anti Semites were about in that time and wanted him pushed into the background but Monash's abilities kept him in the front row. A flawed man in many respects but his job was to reduce casualties and win battles. That he did with aplomb.",
            "This book has personally filled a rather large hole in my understanding of a very important man in Australian History. Sir John Monash accomplished great things for our country and his actions played not just a pivotal role in winning the war, but reducing the number of Australian causulties as he challenged the then British methods of war which often treated soldiers as fodder. The underdog who had a major impact on the course of history. I very much enjoyed the book, although I did sometimes get lost amongst the names of places and battles, but perhaps that says more about me than the author! I would recommend this book generally as an excellent book on an important man who all Australians should know.",
            "Wonderful telling of the life of a great Australian. While Gallipoli may have been the birth of the Anzac tradition, it\u2019s first great victories fighting as a single army cane through Monash\u2019s brilliance as a military leader. He not only changed the direction of the first World War but clearly bought it to a much earlier end. I enjoyed the telling of the story of his early life as an engineer in Melbourne where he worked on many things we continue to enjoy today",
            "Brilliant, captured the man and the many experiences in his life. The absolute appalling generalship by the English aristocracy, the racial bias he endured but was big enough to rise above it all.A great read about a truly great Aussie.",
            "This is one of the finest biographies/histories I have ever read. It deserves to be read by all Australians & anyone interested in WWI. ",
            "Good bio, but more than a tad jingoistic.",
            "Outstanding book if a great Australian that doesn\u2019t gloss over his faults. Should be required school reading rather than some of the other questionable books that our students now read.",
            "Academic, engineer, expert witness, lawyer, successful business man, part time militia at a time when Australia was finding its identity.Rose despite great discrimination of his German/Jewish heritage to become Australia\u2019s greatest military leader and almost probably the greatest of World War 1.He is the father of Anzac Day and one of the greatest military strategists ever. His leadership resulted in the end of the war and prevented the deaths of 100,000s of men on both sides.Monash is the core of our identity and the creator of our national pride as ANZACS. For that alone it is a must read for Australians.Listened to audiobook from a BorrowBox app using Brisbane library card. David Tredinnick is a great narrator even at 1.2x speed. ~25 hours",
            " Monash: The Outsider Who Won a WarI read Geoffrey Serle\u2019s biography back in the early 1980s. It was one of the most impressive biographies that I have read. In my school days I was a devotee of English historians AJP Taylor. I remember him making passing remarks about Monash\u2019s achievements. \u201c\u2026 The only general of creative originality produced in the first world war\u2026\u201d My interest in Monash was stimulated by some comments made by a panel of historians discussing WW1 on Radio National in April. They were slightly dismissive of his contribution to the ending of WW1.Monash: The Outsider Who Won a War is certainly a tome. At first I was worried that it would be a hagiography and the extensive retelling of actual conversation was a bit worrying in a book written by an academic with the standing of Roland Perry. As I later discovered Monash was a prolific writer and Perry did have access to King George\u2019s personal diaries.I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to find out more about Australia\u2019s contribution to the war effort in 1914-18.At time I do think Perry is sweeping and exaggerating Monash\u2019s achievements. I don\u2019t believe he was Australia\u2019s Napoleon. He was far too much of a decent human to be anything like the French autocrat.What this book did reaffirm for me is that every male Murdoch who has inhabited this planet is a ego driven wanker and much the same can be said about Billy Hughes.Sir John must have had a strong sexual drive, he certainly enjoyed the occasional peccadillo We don\u2019t have many heroes in our Australian history but Monash is certainly up there with the bravest and most honourable.I enjoyed the ending of the book where Perry wrote about what happened to many of the individual who were mentioned in the text.A lengthy well researched account of a truly great Australian.",
            "Perry is quite possibly the worst historian I have ever read.After reading another of his contra-factual histories I resolved never to read another book by him.Against my better judgement, the reviews for Monash were so uniformly good that I jumped in.. more fool me.It was in the 1st sentence that I realised how dreadfully sycophantic a piece this would be.that was also read the 2004 review by John Lack who detailed all the weakness that would so quickly become apparent.This is not revisionist history; it is barely even history.. It is gushing hagiography by a boring old fart. A truly dreadful read. Twice. bitten I will never read another fictitious history from this twerp ever again & will do my level best to stop anybody else from ever doing so as well.",
            "waaay too dense. Interesting though",

I also liked his work on Al Kraven, which is to say I was able to read the book without constantly wishing that the character would be stabbed in the eyes. One up on his original creator, Ron Zimmerman, on that score.In addition, this was one of my favorite projects by artist Scott Kolins, who had a great take on the science-gadgety Dr. Hank Pym, the Mike Norton-designed Gravity and Deathlok, among others.",

(Sorry for that spoiler.)Dwayne McDuffie was a key writer on the excellent Justice League Unlimited cartoon, and he tries to have fun with the Marvel continuity here, but with more mixed results. It's fun seeing characters isolated to miniseries like Gravity (who controls gravity), the Hood (who gets his powers from a hooded cloak) and Get Kraven (a craven movie executive), team up. But in any not-hugely publicized miniseries, no huge, lasting events can happen, so when Spider-Man dies in the first issue, you know this book will be eventful but frivolous. There are other dramatic yet cheap plot twists, and an actual, unnecessary death at the end of the book. (Um, that was another (vague) spoiler.) Scott Kolins can be a great artist (like on Flash and  Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes), but here his art is not very clean, and doesn't work well with the cosmic setting.",
            "This was an interesting story, though I don't much have a concept of when it takes place. I can get a rough idea based on some of the characters, though this was my first introduction to some of these characters. The story had interesting twists and turns, and though I thought it wouldn't have any long-term effects, it turned out that it did (though it was with a character I didn't know). Though I don't understand how it fits in with anything, and have never seen any references to it, it was an enjoyable read.",
            "This isn't a great book, but I'm a sucker for stories that take disparate characters, throw them into an unusual situation and force them to get along, it helps that the group includes Hank Pym and the Wasp, two of my favorite Marvel mainstays. The story isn't bad, but it's somewhat slight and the outcome relies on a character that I don't think has ever been portrayed as powerful as the story seems to think he is. Anyway, certainly worth reading."

In this ambitious work of historical fiction, Douglass' passions come vividly to life in the form of two women: Anna Murray Douglass and Ottilie Assing.  Douglass' Women is an imaginative rendering of these two women -- one black, the other white -- in Douglass' life. Anna, his wife, was a free woman of color who helped Douglass escape as a slave. She bore Douglass five children and provided him with a secure, loving home while he traveled the world with his message. Along the way, Douglass satisfied his intellectual needs in the company of Ottilie Assing, a white woman of German-Jewish descent, who would become his mistress for decades to come. How these two women find solidarity in their shared love for Douglass -- and his vision for a free America -- is at the heart of Jewell Parker Rhodes' extraordinary, epic novel.",

            "Loved it! Outstanding fictional read! Even though this was fiction, the author did an amazing job. I only knew of Frederick Douglass as an abolitionist and a runaway slave. I like how the author focused on 2 women in his life at the time, his wife and his mistress. this book gives readers a glimpse into Mr. Douglass' personal life. The story felt so real. The fact is Frederick Douglass did have a mistress, but the way the author tells the story was mostly fiction. This book will definitely leave you feeling some type of way about a man that is a great historical figure. ",
            "In her latest novel, Douglass\u2019 Women, Jewel Parker Rhodes travels back in history to the antebellum and Civil War era to examine the loves of Frederick Douglass. She stretches the imagination by exploring the psyche of Anna, a free woman of color, who loves Douglass almost to a fault and Ottilie Assing, a European, free-spirit who is attracted to the polished and principled Douglass.The novel, told in chronological alternating chapter format, provides the reader a glimpse into the character and upbringing of each woman. Anna is a quiet, hardworking homemaker, devoted wife and mother who clings to the belief that love conquers all. She has a strong sense of family and has witnessed unconditional love between her parents and siblings. Her one wish is to have the same love returned to her from Douglass. Unfortunately, Douglass, a self-taught ex-slave, has been elevated to a level of celebrity and lifestyle that pushes Anna to the background where she reluctantly finds comfort. While her husband is recognized as a skilled orator and accomplished author, Anna is regarded as a recluse and intentionally remains illiterate (despite Douglass\u2019 urging otherwise) which creates an erudite chasm between them that widens as the years progress. Ottilie Assing, a genteel woman of German-Jewish ancestry, works as Douglass\u2019 interpreter. She fills the intellectual void and accompanies Douglass on many engagements. They grow fond of each other and a lifetime love affair begins.Rhodes writes very vividly so the reader clearly understands the similarities, differences, jealousy, envy, and anger each woman feels toward each other and Douglass. Rhodes also parallels the societal prejudices of Jews in Europe to Africans in America which justifies Ottilie\u2019s attraction to Abolitionist views. She also subtly touches the issues surrounding interracial relationships through her character\u2019s dialogue and thoughts. Although this is a work of historical fiction, she carefully follows the actual timeframe of events to effortlessly blend in factual people, places, and excerpts from speeches, which lends credibility to the novel. From a literary standpoint, her use of the \u201cwater-death-freedom\u201d symbolism was handled expertly and was used as the unifying thread for both women\u2019s tales. This reader believes that fans of Rhodes will not be disappointed; this is a good story from an accomplished author!",
            "This was such a good read. I found I could not put it down. I'm familiar with Frederick Douglass. I read the autobiography he wrote in high school. I also learned in college that he supported the suffragettes in their ideals of universal suffrage. So, I felt like I was familiar with his character. This novel exposed a side of him I was totally unfamiliar with. A much less savory, less honorable side. I strongly support fleshing out and adding a touch of realism to historical characters but this felt almost too much. Mostly he was self absorbed and embarrassed by his dark, illiterate wife. I had read that Douglass and his wife worked on the Underground Railroad but that was not included in the book. Ultimately this was well written, well handled and well researched. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
            "Wow! Amazing, compelling, and facinating story of two women who deeply love the same man. Unfortunately his heart belongs to politics and power. Hmmmmm! Sounds familiar. This story takes place in the 1800's, but why does it make me think of many of our recent past and current leaders? ",
            "What a wonderful book. Ms. Rhodes managed to capture two heroine's unique voices in a single book. I am enamored with this story; never want it to end. I'll sip slowly like a sweet hot cup of tea... I finished and it is clear, Rhodes took time studying the life of each of these women and how they related to Douglass. I enjoyed how rich each character was, and in the end found the women were very similar in so many ways. From their loves of their mothers, beliefs in the supernatural and spirit worlds, and also their love for Douglass and the children he and Anna had together. It also goes to show that no one is perfect and some people cannot just make a choice and stick with it for life. They are forever wanting more. Is that wrong? This is a wonderful book. I loved it and highly recommend to others.",
            "Although, this is fiction..My understanding is that is based on some true aspects of Frederick Douglas life. I have always been fond of Frederick Douglas work, but never knew the dual life he led and the relationship he had with the white women while his wife who was barely literate was home having his children. Ms. Rhodes writes this story in a way that catches the readers attention where you don't really hate anyone, but feel sorry for both women. Both women gave something to Mr. Douglas and you as the reader are not sure that they got back what they lost. Neither women alone was enough for Mr. Douglas. That in theory is a sad scenario for any woman. Very good read.",
            "The best book I've read in a long time. Excellent piece of historical fiction. Characters were real, believable, engaging. Time period and events alive and challenging. Wonderful group discussion after this read.",
            "This book was good. However, I did not like the way Frederick Bailey Douglass cheated on Anna Douglass with Ottilie. Douglas could have made Anna's life more easier, but no..... In the end, He didn't choose Ottilie either after the passing of Anna. He got to big for his britches!",
            "Douglass\u2019 WomenBy Jewell Parker RhodesMs. Rhodes is an excellent writer. Her research is nearly flawless, attest to her citations at the end of the book. Her added fiction builds a passionate, emotional story.\u201cDouglass\u2019 Women\u201d is about two very different women loving the same strong, ex-slave, abolitionist, a writer. I believe Ms. Rhodes knew Frederick Douglass had to be included in the story to understand his women. He is an escaped slave afraid of being enslaved again, even by the women in his life. Consequently, he juggles them, accepting their love with little emotional return.Anna Murray Douglass is a free black woman. She\u2019s the stronger of the two women, the realist. She gives her hard-earned money to Freddy to escape his slave master. He later marries her. Anna says Freddy is \u201cSamson-man, standing, perched on the edge of his horizon.\u201d She does not like the name Frederick Bailey Douglass, feels it beyond her as his mate. Anna is steadfast in her loyalty and self-confidence and suffers his infidelity.Ottilie Assing, a German-Jewish woman, teaches him to read and write, and uses his ego and hatred of bondage to keep him near. He becomes Frederick to Ottilie. She is indispensable with her money and time helping him pursue his career. She clearly has a way out of the mistress role, but is too much of a romantic in love to accept the reality of her situation.Both women suffer the pains of unreciprocated love, heartache from their \u201cgreat man.\u201d They learn Freddy/Frederick doesn\u2019t tell either one he loves her. Anna says, \u201cFreddy never really learned to love.\u201dI can only conclude that Frederick, husband, lover, and abolitionist is mentally disturbed as a result of his years as a slave. Freedom is the only thing he seems to focus on. This proves to create both bad and good events in his life. Nevertheless, he needs sexual love, takes it wherever he can get it, when he wants it. Yet, it does not interfere with his plans, in spite of the fact that he fathers five children with Anna. His intimate relationship with Ottilie beats his subconscious. Frederick has no time for women\u2019s suffrage \u2014 says that can come later. He refuses to admit that he is color conscious. He tells Rosetta \u201cI\u2019m married to an old black log. Would you repeat my mistake?\u201d In speaking of his oldest daughter\u2019s love interest, Lucius, he says, \u201cWe\u2019re at war...Fighting for racial uplift. Not degradation.\u201d And further says, \u201cI raised you for better than this. Better than him.\u201d Dear timid Lucius cannot read nor write, but loves Rosetta Douglass.Every page kept me immersed, kept me wondering what next. Jewell Parker Rhodes penned vivid pictures of strong fictional characters, which reflects her understanding of humankind. What an excellent read!Reviewed by Minnie Estelle MillerAuthor of \u201cWhispers from the Mirror.\u201dJuly 6, 2011"

Taylor, in a book that has sold more than 300,000 copies since its original publication in 1957, has helped two generations of art students \"learn to look.\" This handy guide to the visual arts is designed to provide a comprehensive view of art, moving from the analytic study of specific works to a consideration of broad principles and technical matters. Forty-four carefully selected illustrations afford an excellent sampling of the wide range of experience awaiting the explorer. The second edition of Learning to Look includes a new chapter on twentieth-century art. Taylor's thoughtful discussion of pure forms and our responses to them gives the reader a few useful starting points for looking at art that does not reproduce nature and for understanding the distance between contemporary figurative art and reality.",

            "These later, shorter, somewhat quieter essays, shorn of any supplicatory tendency to establish their author's theoretical mark on the world {accomplished as they unarguably are, earlier collections such as Against Interpretation possess, with all their youthful vigour, the capacity to leave one feeling a little intellectually punch-drunk}, remind one most of those votive candles one lights in Church overlooked by tight-lipped icons or at the lacquered feet of alabaster saints. Not because singly any one of these essays necessarily contains the requisite revelatory authority to illuminate the intellectual landscape with the brief but bright incandescence of a flare but rather because collectively they radiate an affirmation of Sontag's simultaneously generous and scrupulous intelligence. There may be nothing ground-breaking about these pieces but they are full of the usual infectious enthusiasms - in this case, under-valued {at least amongst the English-speaking literary establishment} books by Machada de Assis and Witold Gombrowicz, a eulogy for WG Sebald, writings on ballet, Barthes, naturally - perhaps the only false-note being some rather silly gender politics from the introduction accompanying Women, a book of photographs by her lover, Annie Leibovitz.",
            "Her long introduction to the 'Roland Barthes Reader,' reprinted here, is wonderful. The other pieces are less substantial, but readable and informative--good literary journalism. She writes pleasurably about things I'm now into. She would look with approval at the Barthes, Cioran, Kirstein and (James) McCourt on my bookshelves; the availabily of those writers to my noticing is probably partly due to her advocacy, back in the 70s. ",
            "It's interesting. Sontag is such a compelling critic when she writes about writing: fiction, nonfiction, poetry. Famously, she wrote an essay on photography (which I haven't read). But with painting, you get the sense she's flailing around, searching for a vocabulary and a syntax. She seems out of her element in the essay on painter Howard Hodgkin. Perhaps this is uncharacteristic of her writing on the visual arts.When it comes to Wagner, it's all deliciousness. The essay is titled Wagner's Fluids. Two excerpts:1.

            "This is a great book for children to read because it teaches children their ABC's in a new unique way. Instead of using the animals to learn their ABC's they used the animals names to teach the ABC's. This book is also a good way for children to learn animal types, like zebra, dog, and monkey. The illustrations are also very well done with a lot of detail, which helps kids distinguish different things and animals. Also with each character name there is a sentence that describes what each character is doing, which gives the book more life. So, I think that this is a good book to help kids learn the alphabet and names. ",
            "Very cute book! Each page has a unique illustration, and each sentence starts with a new letter of the alphabet. There is also lots of rhyming, which could help a lot of kids with fluency and pronunciation. The book has good representation and shows everyone in the class working together. ",

            " Miss Bindergarten Celebrates the Last Day of Kindergarten is a great book to read with kindergarteners on their last day of school. It tells the story of a teacher named Miss Bindergarten and her class and the great year they had in kindergarten. They reminisce about all of the things they have accomplished during the year such as field trips, a classroom circus, the holidays etc. However, the school year is over so they have to celebrate and say good bye to one another.  I would use this story as my last read aloud during the end of the school year in a kindergarten class. I would begin the year with using Miss Bindergarten Goes to Kindergarten to introduce the many wonderful activities that will occur during the year and draw parallels to this book. Many students will remember activities described in Miss Bindergarten Goes to Kindergarten and how they are repeated in Miss Bindergarten Celebrates the Last Day of Kindergarten. For example, the book about the beginning of the school year illustrates how the teacher sets up her classroom for the first day of school while the second book shows the same teacher taking everything down in the second book. This book is a great way for students to reflect upon their many accomplishment and milestones in their kindergarten year. The classroom teacher could create a list as students list their many accomplishments. Also, the book talks about each student being special and having a moving up ceremony. This would be the perfect opportunity for the teacher to have a moving up ceremony where each student receives a medal or award for being a star in kindergarten. This book is a great way to remember all the wonderful milestones and achievements in kindergarten and to point out all the growth and progress that the students have made during the year. Also, the rhyming words used by the author are a great way to see if students have begun to grasp the sounds that words make and how they can be alike and different. "

        "description": "With scores of millions of books in print, translation into two dozen languages, and one of the most popular heroes in contemporary fiction to his name, #1 New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman is the unequivocal \u201cmaster of the psychological thriller\u201d (People). In his newest novel Kellerman delivers a tour de force\u2013poignant, dark, and chilling\u2013that illuminates a shadowy world where impulse rules. Tanya Bigelow was a solemn little girl when Dr. Alex Delaware successfully treated her obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Now, at nineteen, she still seems older than her years\u2013but her problems go beyond hyper-maturity. Patty Bigelow, Tanya\u2019s aunt and adoptive mother, has made a deathbed confession of murder and urged the young woman to seek Delaware\u2019s help. The doctor recalls Patty as a selfless E.R. nurse struggling to raise a child on her own\u2013a woman seemingly incapable of the \u201cterrible thing\u201d she has admitted. But for Tanya\u2019s peace of mind, Delaware agrees to investigate, and he enlists LAPD detective Milo Sturgis in the search for the phantom victim of a crime that may never have occurred.Armed with only the vaguest details, psychologist and cop follow a trail twisting from L.A.\u2019s sleaziest low-rent districts to its overblown mansions, retracing Patty and Tanya\u2019s nomadic and increasingly puzzling life to the doorsteps of a sullen heroin addict; a randy real-estate broker; and a brilliant, enigmatic physics student. Suddenly a very real murder tears open a terrifying tunnel into the past, where secrets\u2013and bodies\u2013are buried. As the tension mounts, Delaware and Sturgis uncover a tangled history of desperation, vengeance, and death\u2013a legacy of evil that refuses to die. Dramatic, action-packed, and filled with the psychological detail that only Jonathan Kellerman can provide, Obsession is a whodunit, a whydunit\u2013and something unique: a did-it-even-happen? This is Kellerman at his heart-racing best.",

            "Un thriller politist foarte bun in care, in mod inedit, cei care ancheteaza sunt un cuplu alcatuit dintre un psiholog si un politist. Personal, imi plac foarte mult cartile in care, pe langa un detectiv, in desfasurarea cazului este implicat si un psiholog, psihiatru, medic legist sau orice alt specialist, chiar si o bunicuta bagacioasa. Consider ca este normal ca un politist sa nu se priceapa la orice si nici nu-mi place ca intreaga putere si responsabilitate sa se concentreze in mana unui singur om, care adesea poate fi corupt sau slab pregatit.In ceea ce priveste actiunea, o asistenta cumsecade Patty Biggelow ii marturiseste pe patul de moarte fiicei sale adoptive Tanya ca in trecut a omorat pe cineva. Dupa decesul ei, Tanya il contacteaza pe psihologul Alex Delaware pentru a-l ruga sa sape in trecutul mamei sale. Alaturi de el va porni pe acest drum intortocheat al trecutului femeii si detectivul Milo Sturgis. Dupa unele descoperiri crimele incep sa curga si o afacere sordida de multi ani incepe sa fie dezgropata.Daca cei doi vor reusi sa rezolve aceasta enigma a unei presupuse crime si daca Patty este inger sau de fapt demon ramane sa aflati citind romanul.Mi-a placut ca se vorbeste despre tulburarea obsesiv-compulsiva si ca psihologul prefera tratamentul cognitiv - comportamental in locul medicamentelor care sporesc fluxul de serotonina catre creier. Desi tratamentul dureaza mai mult acesta nu are efectele secundare ale medicamentelor.Alt lucru care m-a incantat este faptul ca romanul ofera o foarte buna descriere a Los Angeles-ului si Hollywood-ului amintind de Crescent Heights, Sunset Boulevard, Melrose Place ori Beverly Hills. M-au amuzat in acest sens urmatoarele citate: In Los Angeles",
            "Meh. Two-and-a-half stars, probably.It's okay, but only because Kellerman is an accomplished author, and knows how to tell a tale, but his characters are all seeming, well, stale. Nothing is new here. I didn't really guess who dunnit but I also didn't care a lot. His villian in this one is just plain gross (which is typical Kellerman) and could have been plucked whole from any other Kellerman novel. The woman that Milo and Alex set out to help is supposed to be this very smart",
            "Somewhere between a 3 and 3.5. I may have been distracted so I\u2019m not going to judge this too harshly. I always enjoy Alex and Milo but I\u2019m not sure about this particular plot. Something seemed a bit too much of a stretch maybe. But overall it was a decent story so I\u2019ll just go with it\u2019s not the book, it\u2019s me. Sometimes there is just too much noise to focus. I kept forgetting who some of the characters were. So not bad but not great either.",
            "Jonathan Kellerman has set the bar for psychological thrillers, and he's set it high. Unfortunately, Obsession, the latest in the Alex Delaware series, falls short of his previous achievements. While the usual elements are there -- a previous client needs help, and Delaware and his detective pal Milo Sturgis jump to the rescue -- things feel a bit stale. Everything is just a bit tepid. Their reason for becoming involved in the mystery (a dying request from Sturgis' lover's co-worker) is tenuous at best. Because there is no immediate crime to investigate, just the suspicion of one, things start off slow. And the character development seems to stagnate. Robin, Delaware's live-in love, is a mere two-dimensional place holder with no personality of her own, and nothing new about Delaware's or Sturgis' personalities is revealed. The young girl they're interceding on behalf of is annoying and simple (does this college-aged girl REALLY call her mother Mommy ALL the time???). I wanted her to be guilty of something",
            "Like the title of this installment of the Delaware series, I have a tiny bit of obsession too; mine is with the audio-books of this series narrated by John Rubinstein. Of course the quality of the writing makes that all possible, but still - For me these books are so wonderful to listen to while I'm doing house-chores, cleaning, vacuuming, rearranging closets, and whatnot. There's no better way to pass the time than in the company of Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware and the cast of other habitual peripheral detectives, who are all mostly devoted professional LEOs, with very distinct personalities, which I truly can enjoy.I hope these Delaware series never end and stay on level, quality & story-wise. Fingers crossed.",
            "As a long time fan of both Jonathan Kellerman and Alex Delaware, OBSESSION does not disappoint. As I was immersed once again into another case of past meeting present, I was reminded of how much I love these characters! When Dr. Delaware is contacted by a former patient after her mother dies, a very strange story unfolds. The girl's mother was a saint"

            "In other words",
            "For Lent I am reading a couple of books that cover theological issues surrounding Holy Week and the Passion of Christ. I started with Balthasar's Mysterium Paschale: The Mystery of Easter, since I have previously read and enjoyed Balthasar's Dare We Hope That All Men Be Saved?. Simply put, Mysterium Paschale was a real treat, especially for this time of year.There is a lot to explore and think about in this book, but where Balthasar shines the most is in his treatment of Holy Saturday and Easter. Rejecting the view that Jesus entered into Hades/Sheol as an active victor (as in the Eastern Orthodox tradition), Balthasar asserts that Jesus entered Hades/Sheol as a truly dead man, in full solidarity with every human who has ever died. There is no question of Jesus performing any sort of action during Holy Saturday, because He was simply and passively dead, and in a sense His very humanity was destroyed for a time (as is the humanity of any person separated from their body). It is in going to the dead in this way that Jesus meets and liberates the dead, opening the way for the decision that must always come when encountering Jesus: to choose Him as He has chosen you, or not to. Thus Jesus' death populates not only Heaven but also (potentially) Hell. This is a brilliant theological move and plays nicely with dialectical theology (e.g., that of Karl Barth). Along the way, Balthasar also illuminates the Trinitarian dynamics of the Passion: Christ submits Himself to the Father, who unilaterally hands Christ over to death (thus separating Father and Son), and then (through the Spirit who alone connects the two) the Father raises Him again; the key insight is that, since Jesus was truly dead, and truly separated from the Father, neither He nor the Father could have been the agent of His resurrection, and this is precisely where the Holy Spirit enters into the picture.As for his treatment of Easter, Balthasar deals candidly with the fact that the resurrection accounts in the Gospels are very difficult (if not impossible) to reconcile with one another; despite many similarities, each account also paints a different, seemingly incompatible picture. He compares this to a bright white light entering a prism and being refracted into many different, even opposite, colors; the resurrection stands outside of the old reality but enters into and imprints upon that reality, leaving us to try to explain it with inadequate categories and contradictory stories. Balthasar constructs his theology of Easter in a way that makes room for this; he is unconcerned with harmonizing the Gospels, and instead seeks to draw out the theological message of each account. In doing so, he sheds much light on an otherwise perplexing set of texts. His treatment of the Johannine resurrection account is especially insightful; he suggests that Peter represents the Church of office, while John represents the Church of love, and that their interplay (how they each run to the tomb, how they each interact with Jesus, etc.) is indicative of the interplay between the Church's hierarchical structure and its more spontaneous relationship with its Lord.All in all, this is some good theology to chew on!",
            "Originally, I purchased this work by the noted & respected Catholic theologian, Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-1988), out of interest for reading a theological treatment of the liturgy of the sacred Easter Triduum (Good Friday/Holy Saturday/Resurrection Sunday). It turned out to be a whole lot more than that! Here's how von Balthasar describes it in the Preface: This book appeared for the first time as a constituent chapter of a large-scale dogmatics. Since in that context the doctrine of God as one and triune was treated elsewhere",
            "Will definitely have to give it another slower read- it was dense, even for me. However I don\u2019t particularly like how he treated the descent into hell- really flattening. However I did greatly appreciate his emphasis on the Trinity and his ecclesiological interpretation of the end of the Gospel of John ",
            "Disclaimer, my rating for this book has nothing to do with the level of scholarship. Balthasar did an excellent piece of work here.The reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it didn't hold my attention and I only enjoyed certain parts of it. I would imagine that it is more enjoyable for people that are still actively in the biblical scholarship world.",
            "Super hard to read I don\u2019t know Latin. I didn\u2019t understand the complicated arguments. I guess this maybe more for the scholar and academic.",
            "Excellent scholarship. Unfortunately, it didn't really hold my attention and I only enjoyed certain parts. Probably better suited for active biblical scholars.",

She goes horseback riding with the departed's daughter and does some nosy cold calling too. Love it! I notice that at the end of each of these Holt Mrs. Malory series, Hazel tends to put a 180 degree detail to what we THINK the innocent but suspected character would do. A twisted angle by one of the key protagonists which has little to do with the crime, but which is perceptive to human's duplicity. This is always at the very end, after the solve or reveal. This time it was that the heartily defended one actually did sneak and take the easy way out, about something else entirely. Easy and entertaining reads. Enjoyed! ",

Unfortunately Francis is unwilling to sell.David comes to stay with Sheila to try and persuade Francis to change his mind as Culminster isn't far from where Sheila lives in Taviscombe. The book paints a picture of a very dominant and unpleasant man. Francis controls his two adult children, Adrian and Mary and his downtrodden wife Joan. Hardly anyone is upset when Francis is found dead in suspicious circumstances.I almost didn't want the murderer found as I felt so sorry for all the obvious suspects. The solution is actually a surprise when it comes and I definitely didn't spot what was going on. I like Sheila Malory as a character and the low key mysteries in this series make a change from tense psychological thrillers.",

This is another pleasant tale of Sheila Malory and the denizens of the village of Taviscombe. Intermixed with the the tale of her friend David and his hated brother Francis are the pleasant daily details of life in a small village. A pleasant cozy mystery.",

        "description": "With world oil production about to peak and inexorably head toward steep decline, what fuels are available to meet rising global energy demands? That question, once thought to address a fairly remote contingency, has become ever more urgent, as a spate of books has drawn increased public attention to the imminent exhaustion of the economically vital world oil reserves. Deffeyes, a geologist who was among the first to warn of the coming oil crisis, now takes the next logical step and turns his attention to the earth's supply of potential replacement fuels. In Beyond Oil, he traces out their likely production futures, with special reference to that of oil, utilizing the same analytic tools developed by his former colleague, the pioneering petroleum-supply authority M. King Hubbert.The book includes chapters on natural gas, coal, tar sands and heavy oils, oil shale, uranium, and (although not strictly an energy resource itself) hydrogen. A concluding chapter on the overall energy picture covers the likely mix of energy sources the world can rely on for the near-term future, and the special roles that will need to be played by conservation, high-mileage diesel automobiles, nuclear power plants, and wind-generated electricity.An acknowledged expert in the field, Deffeyes brings a deeply informed, yet optimistic approach to bear on the growing debate. His main concern is not our long-term adaptation to a world beyond oil but our immediate future: \"Through our inattention, we have wasted the years that we might have used to prepare for lessened oil supplies. The next ten years are critical.\" ",

            "This is a really enjoyable, but disturbing, book. While some may dispute the analysis presented here, Kenneth Deffeyes does present an excellent accounting of the potential energy resources available after the easy oil (easily recoverable",
            "The fat lady is singing (p. 49)Hubbert's Peak is at the top of the bell-shaped curve of world oil production",
            "Geologist discusses gas, coal, heavy oil, oil shale, uranium, and hydrogen for energy use.Some economics and suggestions for individuals. Get hydrogen electric car, shorten commute. Use a bike and walk instead of driving.Buy local, in-season crops. Can and preserve your own food.Get LED lights.Use less ac/heating. Get exhaust fans - one for attic heat others for windowsFor the really serious - insulate house, use solar/wind etc power, put on a sod-roof.",
            "This is an old book, published in 2006, but I wanted to compare the past predictions to today\u2019s cheap oil prices. Of course, today\u2019s prices are more related to politics (and the pandemic), not actual world demand. The book focus on the technical aspects of the debate. But it is quite plainly written, and more importantly it lays very solid groundwork to discuss oil alternatives.",
            "Written by an oilman, this View from Hubbert's Peak is reluctant to bite the hand that fed him and certainly posits the continued existence of industrial civilisation. That apart, the message is as stark as Climate Wars and The Long Emergency but not Deep Green Resistance.It's a hard read but not for that reason: the thoughts are haphazard and some are pure non sequiturs. A good editor would have reigned Mr Deffeyes in. A pity because I think I've teased out the essence of Hubbert's Peak, with a struggle. It has its roots in population dynamics, which roughly say: you can tell how much is left to come by how much has been used and is being used. In other words: bar a miracle the future is knowable.And the future is the downswing of the oil production pendulum. Now. So what will replace it as fuel?The chapters on tar sands and shale oil confirm that, despite the modern hysteria, both are as old as industry itself. Travel between Edinburgh and Glasgow to see the remains of historic workings, for instance. Cheap oil gushing out of the ground put paid to these, the key word being cheap. Now that liquid oil is dearer, it pays to exploit these harder-to-work sources. But they will still produce expensive oil, maybe too expensive.An earlier chapter on coal presents a similar story: it'll return to fashion, along with most of its old pollution and health problems.So to uranium, i.e. nuclear. If Deffeyes is slightly optimistic about it, he was writing before Fukushima. Nuclear is now pretty much a dead duck and we skip quickly on to hydrogen, our saviour.Not. It too is mature technology that still only delivers 40% of the energy put into it. Oh, we may struggle up to 50% but that's a loss nonetheless.Since this is a book about fuel, wind and solar occupy one sentence, which is about appropriate for the contribution they'll make to our gargantuan energy needs anyhow. Both also are offspring of the business-as-usual model and Deffeyes' conclusion that BAU is not on the cards also puts them in their place.That's it for the inside scoop. Just a shame about the scattergun organisation of the book.",
            "So I bought this book thinking it was going to be all about the next clean burning miracle fuel that's lined up to replace oil, and well, turns out there isn't one yet. The book is about how the world basically hit it's peak potential oil output back in 2005-2006, that world oil production is going to steadily decline from here on, and that most current potential oil alternatives actually depend on hydrocarbons at one and sometimes multiple stages in their manufacture. It wasn't the book of hope that I thought I was buying",
            "Good book. Introduced me to the idea that the world is running out of accessible cheap oil. I really liked the technical aspect of it. The math behind the phenomena reinforced some things I learned in statistics. What I enjoyed the most though was the explanation of the different energy sources available today. The descriptions were somewhat technical but as a budding engineer it was great. It would be hard for someone to pick this up with out a science background. "

            "As an ordinary consumer of the written word and narrative, and as a gay bloke who enjoys well crafted stories of adventure, it would be hard not to enjoy Brandon Fox's trilogy Pledged to Magic. The third book, Sex Rites concludes this grand epic in fine style, a satisfactory HFN with strong HEA overtones, yet leaves room for a to-be-hoped-for continuation.Fox has boxed clever with these stories: how can an author fail with a bunch of late adolescents frozen at their age by the magic they enact, yet benefiting from the mental experience of advancing age? Hunky, ever-horny, handsome, and passionate, Thane, Ander, Eric, Skorri, and newcomer, sex-starved Dannel work their magic through intense and protracted sex. This could so easily degenerate into a mere excuse for steamy scenes, but Fox's skill as an author makes the act of sex-magic really work, and he never loses sight of the outcome of the spells cast to drive forward the narrative.So it goes without saying that the graphically described sex is hot and, in Sex Rites, almost non-stop, but the sense of danger and adventure permeates the story as the young men seek the answer to a new mysterious power. The discoveries the intrepid explorers make blends in science-fiction to the heady fantasy world created in the previous books, as they encounter a force beyond the zamindar's grisly blood magic and a match for their own sex-magic.Well drawn characters, gripping plot, a poetic but unfussy writing style, and a celebration of gay love in all its uninhibited exuberance make this a trilogy of novels to linger in the mind.

            "This book is the last of a trilogy, and the arc of the series is resolved in a way that offers lasting change for the story's world, not just our studly heroes. It has some of the best sex scenes of the series.Other books in the trilogy:Book 1: Apprenticed to PleasureBook 2: Conjuring the Flesh",
            "For what is supposed to be the final book of a trilogy, this feels much more like a middle book, with the story unfinished and the ending of this episode rather rushed. ",

            "Bleh. Mary Balogh had this format she used for a time in her earlier books where the heroine was keeping a secret from the hero and this is the driving point for most of the plot. I can tolerate it once in a while but after more than two books it gets annoying. For example I can deal with it in her book Heartless because I loved the hero in that one. This book features this plot device and it is ANNOYING. It starts off with a meet cute premise\u2026the hero",
            "Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This was not a bad read. It's just that in 2019, I'm planning to be a little more discerning in my ratings. I've been known as a high grader before :)This was a fluffy piece. Light and fun in places. No real substance, and based on a very unbelievable premise (tho one that HRs tend to use): the H marries a complete stranger, an impoverished distant cousin, in 2 days by special license. It is the reason that he marries her that's weird. He just did it to avoid being badgered into a different marriage with a jewel of the ton by his female relatives. This is not the first time MB has used this plot device. In The Arrangement she did the same thing. The H runs away and marries a stranger because he doesn't have the balls to stand up to the female relatives he loves.I wonder if this actually happened back in the time period these novels are set. That would be very strange indeed.Anyway, this is the premise, and after doing this crazy thing, the H then plays the part of a level-headed, indulgent, mature husband, while the h is herself - bubbly, natters on, big-hearted, and honestly not very smart. The explanation is that she thinks with her heart instead of her brain. Which is another way of saying she doesn't do much thinking.I give it 3 stars because the writing reminds me of Jane Austen novels - in terms of the banter and lightness. There are parts that are believable - like how the couple don't both achieve orgasm in lovemaking until they are actually in love. Overall, it's something to read while I'm snacking on things and want to multi-task. This is not the sort of novel that commands my entire attention. I can put it down at any time.",
            "This was a light and fun romantic comedy tale with just enough heart to it to keep it an engaging tale. It had plenty of humour but also stood out from the crowd due to the fact that the characters were not your usual HR standard fare. I liked the change. In some ways the tone and feel of this reminded me of Amanda Quick's HR books. Which is a good thing in my eyes. The plot was crazy but fun. Miles Ripley, Earl of Severn, is despairing the fact that his meddling mother and sisters are due in London within a week and are bringing with them the girl they are determined to see him married to. Miles loves his family but has no desire to settle down with a wife. He even claims to his friend that the ideal wife for him would be meek, quiet, plain, and easily forgotten about. His friend laughs off Miles crazy claim but the offhand remark sticks in Miles mind and the very next day, when just such a woman pops up at his door claiming she needs his help, it prompts him to offer her marriage as a solution to both their problems. It all goes wrong for the hapless Miles as it quickly becomes apparent that his ideal wife Abigail Gardiner is not at all the quiet",
            "It's hard to be overly critical with a category romance. After all, given the word limitations and page restrictions, it's not fair to expect the same depth, intrigue, and character development as a full story. Yet surprisingly, quite a few authors actually do it, and do it well. Which is why the genre is so well loved. Mary Balogh built a career on it and became one of the most respected leaders in category romances. But, for some reason this book didn't quite deliver the punch I've come to expect from her. The premise was interesting. The story flowed smoothly. The characters were not cardboard cut out figures, and there was enough intrigue to keep me turning the pages. But, the story missed the mark. My biggest issue was the heroine. Abigail, annoyed me. Most of her bumbling ways and thoughtless attitudes would be considered appalling even by today's standards. The thought that the ton adored her and found her amusing",
            "This is so terrible that I am considering not finishing it even though I have endured 80% of the story. It follows a destitute governess Abigail and an earl, Miles. Their big character flaw? They don't make sense. Abigail is a nearly destitute woman but once she has money, she has no problem spending it and not making any savings. Miles, he is marriage shy. So what does he do? He marries. This was such a frustrating read because Abigail is so over the top annoying. I don't like her because she is loud. I don't like her because she is dumb and she has no scruples spending someone else's money. She accrued a 7500 pounds of debt within a week and it was so galling to read someone like that. She lies compulsively and doesn't even have a respect for her husband to tell him the truth, the source of money. She doesn't think about the damages she makes. In the end, it is all about her. I don't like her, not because she is demanding, I don't like her because she is demanding and dumb, a scary combination. She demands outrageous schemes with no heed to her actions. Her character flaw wasn't really that she was demanding and independent. She just talks a lot about nothing and that is supposedly charming. The only way she could get away with it is a convenient fast love. Of course, that is engineered by the author. Miles falls in love with her when they get married. I don't know why. The fantastic conversations happen off screen because I don't know what she could possibly say to delight him. The conversations in writing are mediocre at best, nothing to flutter your heart. It was just terrible. They have known each other for a week and Miles just smiles at her supposed quirky nature. I guess what I dislike the most is that for a character who supposedly supported her family through hard times, she was remarkably dumb. I saw no evidence of her hustling. It is either she is delusional or she transformed into another person. I could deal with the love fest in the beginning but the bait and switch characters the author did was too much. I dislike both of them immensely because they were poorly written. Miles looks at her way too fondly for a man who is married to a stranger. She is too free with someone's finances. I felt for Miles' friend, who clearly saw she was no good, but has to hold his tongue because he loves her. I suppose the biggest flaw in this book is Abigail. She was supposed to be charming. I was supposed to fall in love with her. I was supposed to see her mismatched pairings and really dumb schemes to be cute. No. Whatever she is serving Miles, I'm not getting. I'm not in love with her and she can't get away with her schemes. This book is terrible. ",
            "Abigail needs a letter of recommendation, and applies to her distant, distant, basically-on-another-continent-distant cousin, Miles. Who happens to be a hot Earl. So, he asks her to marry him because REASONS. (Mainly that she's plain and demure and WHY THE HELL NOT RIGHT.) Except feelings get in the way!!! OH NO. 1. MOC BOOKS WHY DO I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. This wasn't even that good because basically 10 minutes after saying I do",
            "There\u2019s nothing like starting a book and discovering, halfway into the first chapter, that it has all of your favorite tropes. Every time I think to myself \u201cHmm, maybe Mary Balogh isn\u2019t my favorite historical romance author\u2026?\u201d I get hit with an absolutely delightful novel that gives me the happiest of Happy Feels. I should\u2019ve learned better by now.All this to say: The Ideal Wife is splendid and amazing and astoundingly honest. I enjoyed it tremendously, and it might have to be my favorite Balogh novel (of the 13 I\u2019ve read so far).The book opens with Miles, the Earl of Severn, complaining about all the women in his life running the show and bossing him around. He\u2019s had quite enough of that, thank you! He tells his friend that his \u201cideal wife\u201d would be plain, quiet, and submissive; and he says that if met such a woman, he\u2019d marry her straight away. It\u2019s all sort of a joke, of course, but it\u2019s very evident Miles is not interested in any kind of \u201cmanaging\u201d women in his life anymore. Which is very understandable.Anyway, Miles arrives home and is informed he has a poor distant relation named Abigail Gardiner waiting for him. He meets Miss Gardiner, and realizes right away she\u2019s the spitting image of his \u201cideal wife!\u201d So he does what anyone would do in the situation, he proposes on the spot. Abigail, not being a stupid woman, realizes she\u2019d be insane to pass up on a chance to become a countess, and boom: Miles and Abigail get married two days later.Except we have one teensy problem: Abigail is not actually Miles\u2019 \u201cideal wife.\u201d Not even close. She talks nonstop, isn\u2019t the least bit shy, is impetuous, silly, has a zany sense of humor, and has a lot of opinions. Oh, and she\u2019s not nearly as plain-looking as Miles originally though. Oh dear.The good news is: Miles fucking loves Abigail even though she\u2019s not what he signed up for! Like, he\u2019s nuts about her. Absolutely besotted. At some point he realizes that he\u2019s accidentally married a woman who\u2019s the exact opposite of what he thought he wanted, but he\u2019s not bothered at all. Instead, he has boatloads of fun with his new countess and everything seems to be going swimmingly, right off the bat.I can tell you now, this is not how I expected The Ideal Wife to go. If a romance author were writing this book today, there would be a lot of conflict and angst over Abigail\u2019s personality not meeting Miles\u2019 expectations. He\u2019d feel deceived, they\u2019d have a fight, they\u2019d prepare to separate, then there would be groveling and a sweeping declaration of love at the end. That\u2019s the standard plot. But Mary Balogh has always been a different sort of author, even way back in 1991. This is why she\u2019s manages to be a bestseller for over 30 years.The reason I loved this book was that it dealt forthrightly and honestly with any issues as they arose. For instance, Miles and Abigail don\u2019t have great sex on their wedding night. And they don\u2019t have splendid sex the next night, either. Or the next. They\u2019re two strangers, Regency-era wives weren\u2019t expected to enjoy sex, and there\u2019s always a learning curve with a new partner no matter what century it is. Our couple gets the hang of it eventually, of course. But do you know how rare it is to read a scene where the main characters have mediocre sex? That was so truthful and refreshing and I just...ahhhh!I also love Abigail and how Balogh handled her throughout the novel. For one thing, nobody ever shames her for being a somewhat silly chatterbox who tells outrageous jokes. That\u2019s just who Abigail is, and everyone takes her as they find her. Even Miles. And while, yes, Miles thought he wanted a particular kind of woman for a wife, he immediately admits that what he thought he wanted never would have worked out for him, and instead he allows himself to be charmed by his slightly more unconventional bride.But then you might ask: so where is the conflict in this book???And, alas, I would have to tell you that the conflict in The Ideal Wife comes from Abigail having a Big Secret that she must hide from Miles at all costs, and which looms over the entire novel like a big stormcloud. Yeah, I know. It\u2019s not my favorite trope, either. Especially since Miles obviously doesn\u2019t give a fig about Abigail\u2019s Shameful Past at all. He loves her! He thinks she\u2019s great the way she is, problems and all. Silly Abigail.I understand that Balogh needed to have some kind of obstacle that had to be overcome before her couple could get their Happily Ever After. I don\u2019t even think, in this instance, the Big Secret trope was out of place. Miles marries Abigail practically the second he meets her, and it would only follow that she has some issues that she\u2019d need to explain to him that she\u2019d be worried he might not like. I just think the secret was dragged out too long in this book, until the reader becomes almost frustrated with Abigail and begins to dislike her (slightly).But, overall? The Ideal Wife is splendid! It\u2019s lighthearted but also realistic, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult to find in Regency romances. Most novels in this genre are either dark and realistic or fluffy and somewhat lacking in substance. Here, Balogh bridges the gap between the two extremes and greats a feel-good love story that still has a ring of truth to it. I loved this.\ud83d\udccc .

            "This book was captivating for me. This book came into my possession in a period of transition when I was in the midst of moving after having travelled half-way around the world. I was sitting in the strange house that would become our new home, surrounded by boxes and paraphernalia with movers milling through the house. In such a highly stimulated environment I needed a retreat and this book was it. I spent much of that morning curled up on the bare mattress of my sister's bed devouring and being absorbed by this book. Its funny how some of the simplest things in life are some of the most beautiful and profound. Something as simple as going to the library and picking up this book really nourished my turbulent spirit. This book will always have fond memories for me. I would love to be able to give this to someone else so they can experience it too.",

However this guide takes you by the hand and leads you willingly to a place where faeries exist, a place where they play, dance and dream.

So how could we not love a book involving all three of our favorite things? If you love Froud's art, you'll love this book. If you are fascinated by the Norse Runes, here's another interesting interpretation. And if you love all things Elfin, as we do, then here is fine addition to modern Elven Culture.

            "This is the earliest of bell hooks' books that I've read, and the first time I've read about her family and educational background in so much detail. At the start of the book, she discusses how talking about these topics has been difficult for her because they are not permissible topics in her milieu, for instance, black people and other people of colour have protected themselves from aspects of white supremacy by keeping quiet (also, she talks about ridiculing the thoughtless, annoying, self-obsessed way white people often talk about themselves, a ridicule that can discourage people from talking about any personal stuff at all). This is one of the many ways she addresses in this book the modes of silencing that operate against black women and other marginalised people. The title reflects her determination to refuse to be silenced, to speak against regulations and expectations. She quotes from Audre Lorde's poem 'Litany for Survival':and when we speak we are afraidour words will not be heardnor welcomedbut when we are silentwe are still afraidSo it is better to speakrememberingwe were never meant to surviveShe also explains her choice of pseudonym \u2013 bell hooks was a female relative remembered as someone who spoke boldly, out of turn. A longer essay towards the end of the book elaborates on this and how useful she found the pseudonym to take to focus away from herself and to what she had to say. This relates to her critique of the feminist saw 'the personal is political', which she appreciates but flags as dangerous, arguing that while politics may begin with the personal, if we stop there, if we don't move beyond the personal into community and solidarity, then the world doesn't change.Another key theme here is race, sex and class in the education system, particularly in graduate school. Mostly, she is discussing structural oppression, but discrimination in her own experience was often quite overt; she shares that at least one of her teachers told her openly that he would fail her regardless of the quality of her work, and that she and other students were constantly discouraged from focussing on the work of black women. She draws on her experience as a teacher to think through issues that are still highly relevant, such as whether a white person should write about black people or other people of colour. On this question, she suggests that what is problematic is the white person being seen as an authority on the topic, something that is likely to happen regardless of their intentions. Writing about a group of people you don't belong to, who are more marginalised than you, could be a very misguided attempt to be an ally:In a conversation with a Chicano historian about white scholars writing about Chicano history, he mentioned a conference where a famous white male spoke of the necessity of white people writing on Chicanos so as to give the subject scholarly legitimacy, to ensure that such work would receive proper attention, consideration, and scholarly respectStill, this nuanced essay isn't condemnatory of all such writing, and she critiques Joanna Russ' book How to Suppress Women's Writing for the way Russ humbly 'stresses the importance of literature by women of color by saying that as a white woman scholar she was not in a position to speak about these works. Towards the end of the book, she listed many quotes from women of color ostensibly encouraging readers to read these writers, to see their words as important. Yet this gesture disturbed me because it also implied that women of color represent this group whose experiences and whose writing is so removed from that of white women that they cannot address such work critically and analytically. This assumption may very well reinforce racism. It helps take the burden of accountability away from white women and places it solely onto women of color.'in essays such as 'towards a revolutionary feminist pedagogy' (the titles generally make you want to jump up and shout YEAH) she critiques traditional college teaching practices which place the teacher in an authoritarian role. She is especially disappointed by white male Marxist professors who use traditional styles, pointing to the hypocrisy of preaching liberatory practice while failing to embody it. Hooks often quotes Paulo Freire and describes aspects of her own teaching practice wherein she attempted to move towards a liberatory pedagogy, making it necessary for each student to contribute. She stresses that this was hard for the students and that they often reacted negatively, and this made it hard for her too; she had to give up her need to be liked by students. However, many students would come to her after courses had finished and share that they had gained so much, and failed to realise it at the time, so the rewards come, just late.Yet another issue raised about Women's Studies courses is the tendency to see white women's work as theoretical while black women's writing could contribute only lived experience; on many courses the only work assigned by black women was The Color Purple, and this would often be the only non-theoretical work. It is a struggle for black women gain recognition as intellectuals or feminist philosophers rather than as experts only on black women's experience.The Color Purple gets a happier mention in discussions of heterosexism = ) I always find hooks' work on pop culture memorable and incisive, and that includes her strong critique of Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It here.I really enjoyed hooks' discussions of class and education that wove in a lot of autobiographical material. As always, she uses a personal approach to bring such a fine clarity to her work and the effort to make it accessible and avoid 'linguistically convoluted' writing is evident.Discussions of violence in intimate relationships and the shortcomings and white supremacy of much white women's feminist practice begin here and are addressed in more depth in her later work, but the essay on feminism and militarism stuck out to me; she strongly rejects the idea that women are inherently less violent than men and the image of women as natural nurturing pacifists that some anti-militarist activists were using. Non-violence is not a biological impulse!It was also moving to read some of hooks' thoughts on black women's writing as well as other forms of 'coming to voice'. She speaks about her own great difficulty writing her first book Ain't I a Woman while working full time and then how hard it was to get it published. If she hadn't been incredibly determined, this book might never have been written. I shudder to imagine a world without bell hooks...Her wish for feminism to resume existence beyond its problematic location in the academy has at least come true \u2013 whether feminists are meeting in small groups to share their thoughts I don't know, but the internet has done more than most folks' wildest dreams in the '80s to create community & connection.",
            "bell hooks is one of the best theorists of 20th-21st C feminism and this, one of her early books, is an outstanding analysis of how to oppose sexism and racism. Perhaps a timely re-read for me know during the oppressive era of Drumpfism, I recall it was one of my favourite books of hers along with Ain't I A Woman and Bone Black. Definitely worth your time - her writing is engaging and witty and absolutely, sadly relevant still 27 years later.",
            "It's hard for me to put into words how much I loved this book, but I will have to soon as it's part of my dissertation reading list. One reason I love? I'm a fan of blending the academic with the personal, with writing that aids in elevating the mind but doesn't put up a wall between the words and the reader. Another reason? This book called me to remember my own life, own stories and how being black and female was read, handled, and lived in the many spaces I've traveled in my life. Another reason? It's a call to everyone, not just black women or black people, but all people who want to end sexism, racism, classism, all forms of oppression that binds groups and keeps them from having voices in their stories, in their worlds. It is one of those books that as you read, you can feel your brain shifting, you can feel thoughts being questioned and examined. It makes you become critical--and not in a bad way. We would all do well to not take everything at face value, to look at not only ourselves but also others to make the world and spaces we traverse in betters venues for all people. Much more I could write, but I'll save that for another day.",
            "This is the first book of hers that I've read, but already I love bell hooks. In each essay, her warmth and compassion and personality comes through, even as she tackles topics in a rigorous academic way. She doesn't see the two as opposites unrelated worlds, but aims to bring feminism and racial justice activism to everyday people, i.e. the people who need it the most. In every realm, she is constantly questioning herself and the institutions around her for signs of the culture of domination, for she thinks that this is the root cause of more obvious societal ills like white supremacy and sexism. However, that same root cause can creep up even in places that are supposed to teach you NOT to be sexist or racist: the liberal college classroom, where the professor, just by the way she communicates, can unconsciously further the dynamic of domination towards his/her students. This is just one example of many, but her constant self questioning is very refreshing to hear. She always starts from a concrete personal story, but transcends the personal to talk about the systemic issues that it brings up.",
            "absolutamente incr\u00edvel, leiam todos imediatamente ",
            "This is a book I've been interested in reading for quite some time, and it paid off!\u00a0 My only regret is that I didn't purchase my own copy, because alas, I couldn't bear to mark up a library book.\u00a0 bell hooks is an utterly necessary author to read in expanding one's knowledge about feminism and how it intersects with race, gender, sexuality, and class.\u00a0 She critiques mannerisms of talking, analyzing, critiquing, and what it means both in and outside her classroom, and what it means for one's self.\u00a0\u00a0Her essays in this collection are just so incredibly powerful and meaningful--it's no wonder that they're a keystone of feminist literature.\u00a0 What I took away from this book was her urging to critically think and analyze one's own feminism, as well as to identify just exactly what is meant by the personal is political",
            "As pure coincidence, I began reading this book just a few days before my workplace had a training about Power & Privilege. The trainer had an enlarged bell hooks quote posted at the front of the room. Both the training and this book gave me plenty of ideas to mull over and discuss with friends, including how feminism should include discussions of men, how education can be a force of oppression, and how unchecked white women have and can be harmful to progressing feminist and anti-racist movements. Something we talked about in the training was the four levels of oppression: (intra)personal, interpersonal, institutional, and systemic. Often white people feel comfortable talking about the last two (if they feel comfortable at all) because it allows one to speak on the subject in an abstract and theoretical way, and can take the emphasis off of personal responsibility. In Talking Back, bell hooks touches on all four levels and how they feed off one another, and how we cannot ignore any of them if we ever hope to make radical changes.",
            "bell hooks presents an amazing analysis of race, gender, sexism, misogyny, pedagogy, and education, combining them all through personal anecdotes of her own life. her essays on education as domination are superb. she constantly references paulo freire whom i desperately need to read. she deconstructs the racist, sexist origins of academia to force a space for Black women that is rightfully theirs.",
            "This is a book of essays by Bell Hooks. I love it when you're feeling a certain way about an issue but you're at a lost for words or can't express your thoughts. Bell Hooks speaks for me in so many ways. I found myself speaking out loud, reading passages to members of my family, adding my own thoughts in the margins on just about every page. I loved it! ",
            "Based on how long it took me, it was a very dense read - I would expect no less from solid feminist theory. I\u2019m familiar with hooks\u2019 other works and did find this to be more rudimentary and reflective. "

She has spent the summer on her Colorado ranch working with Sprocket, the service dog she has been training, and helping her mother, who is expecting twins. In addition, Nicki's best friend Becca was away all summer, and Nicki has gotten to be close friends with Kris, one of the new girls at their school.The start of a new school year is usually an exciting time for Nicki, but this year it's laced with sadness because it means that Sprocket will soon leave for advanced training and eventual placement with a person with special needs. Starting school is also more challenging this year because it means trying to maintain close friendships with both Kris and Becca, who don't know each other very well.Can Nicki find a way to let Sprocket go AND to keep both Kris and Becca close?",

            "This book is about a girl who has to give up the dog she trained so he can become a service dog. she has to learn to cope with that, but on top of it she has to get her 2 bffs to get to like each other. At the same time her mother is on bed rest.This is a fun but sad book. You will love it.I recommend this book to all girls who love dogs.",
            "slow at frist ",
            "Sprocket finally got a home with someone he could help, even though Nicki was really sad to have to let go. Some things are really hard to let go, but you have to.",
            "Summary:When Nicki's mother finds out she has to be on bed rest due to her being pregnant with twins, Nicki has to take on training a service dog named Sprocket. Nicki becomes very attached to Sprocket. She has done a great job in training him to be a successful service dog, but she hopes his does not pass his advanced training. The thought of Sprocket leaving makes her cry. Nicki also makes a new friend over the summer. Nicki's best friend, Becca, was away the whole summer. When they start their first day of fifth grade, Nicki has to break the news to Becca that she made a new friend named Kris over the summer. Kris is one of the new girls at school and does not get along with Nicki's close friend Becca. She struggles to get both of her friends to get along. The start of school is usually an exciting time for Nicki, but this start is not. She is sad Sprocket has to be given away to some with special needs and that her two friends can not get along. Will Nicki be able help Becca and Kris become friends and will she overcome her sadness of having to give Sprocket away to someone in need?Evaluation:I loved this book because it shows the strong bond between the main character Nicki and the dog, Sprocket. I believe this story helps young children understand the journey of training a dog to become a service dog and how much of an impact service dogs have on people with special needs. It also showed the true meaning of friendship and that one is able to have more than one friend. Teaching Idea:A great teaching idea would be to teach students all about service dogs. Most younger students probably do not know what a service dog is. The teacher could talk about service dogs and how important they are to people with a disability. The teacher may discuss ways in which a service dog may be needed. For instance, some service dogs have the ability to determine when a person is about to have a seizure. I think this is a great way to learn all about service dogs. Something else cool would be to have a well educated speaker with a service dog come in to a class and talk to students about service animals. They could even bring the service dog if the school allowed it.",
            "Maybe it\u2019s because I finished it late and I\u2019m tired, but the end did something to me few books have done before: It made me tear up. Which for me, is a bit of a big deal.Just as strong as the first one. Had a few detail I\u2019d vote to change, but over all a great book.",
            "It was so sad when Nicki had to give Sprocket away! First it was 21 days and then BOOM! The day to give him up was there! I wish that Sprocket had failed his training and she could have kept him.",
            "Nicki is a great generous and sweet girl! She has ben taking off her summer and training Sprocket to be a dog that helps people who are blind. That isn't even the minimum of what she has to do, she has to help her mom who is expecting twins. with Becca her best friend gone skiing all summer Nikki became close friends with kris. Now the first day of fifth grade approaches and nicki is very worried. Will Becca be happy that Nikki became close friends with kris. how much longer does Nicki have until sprocket is tested to be a trained dog for bling and people who are disabled who need him?",
            "Saying goodbye is always hard, especially to someone whose been such a big part of your life. Nicki has to give up the service dog she's worked so hard to train. And to top it all off, it seems like everything in her life is changing - from her friendships, her school life, and even things at home as her mother's due date approaches.Like last time, Nicki learns how to cope with all that life throws at her. She's a remarkable girl and her books are well worth reading. Definitely recommended!"

        "description": "  Deemed \"irreplaceable\" by Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson assumed his nickname during the Battle of Bull Run in the Civil War. It is said that The Army of Northern Virginia never fully recovered from the loss of Stonewall's leadership when he was accidentally shot by one of his own men and died in 1863. Davis highlights Stonewall Jackson as a general who emphasized the importance of reliable information and early preparedness (he so believed in information that he had a personal mapmaker with him at all times) and details Jackson's many lessons in strategy and leadership.",

            "This account of Thomas Stonewall Jackson was very illuminating but could also be very starry-eyed. It was interesting",
            "With this biography, I fascinated my family with a Civil War figure from the past about whom I previously knew very little towards absolutely nothing.I was told to get this biography because of who this figure actually is. I greatly appreciate this figure's military prowess, like the other great strategic minds I'm extremely familiar with, i.e. Lao Tzu, Thucydides, Caesar.I studied those specific minds the most of them all. This book I see mentions Ulysses which I remember vaguely reading in high school English (and rather disliking). Yuck. Strategically let's just let this book be.I skimmed great portions of this book after that which was talking about Stonewall Jackson, which were mentioning Napoleon, another great general, whom I respect, and it mentions a spymaster as well... (A certain proportion of my friends accuse me of being a spy, and they've done it for years, but I deny all of these allegations. I am not fluent enough in Russian or French.)There are plenty of details to clear the general matter up, but I don't want to touch my former dislike so that will remain shrouded in the clouds of mystery. (Not that I dislike Napoleon - there was another book in my middle school English class I absolutely couldn't bear.)With this book, I also explored a new section of the library! I had never actually been in the biography section IRL before. The reference librarians want to know who I want and voila, here is the book! (Wherever the accent is, I'm not sure - it may be on the a. Google verifies - voil\u00e1!)",
            "This is probably a banned book given the current political climate in which some want to be rid of anything that puts a seemingly good light on anyone associated with slavery or the former Confederate States of America, but as a history teacher, I think there is some value in knowing about the past, so we do not repeat the bad things our history contains. I found this book at a library's book sale, and I considered it worth buying. I only paid $1 for it, so it was a good value.Anyway, overall, this book gave me a different perspective on Stonewall. I took a semester-long course on the Civil War in college, but this book highlighted information on Jackson not included in survey courses. I feel it is a good summary of Stonewall's life and influence. Yes, he fought for the South, but that does not mean his generalship is not of value. Even I learned that his fighting style influenced generals in later wars.My critiques of this book are that it seems brief, should have included maps to describe the movement of troops, and contained some typographical errors.",
            "This Thomas Stonewall Jackson biography is accessible due to its compact format and its crisp writing. Very informative and far from hagiographic",
            "Good read for an overall review of Thomas Jackson's (Stonewall) military life. Didn't go into details about his life outside of the military though.",
            "This is a book about a war more than a biography of an individual, war books are mundane and ubiquitous. Civil war books and books about Stonewall Jackson's participation in it, are dozens. Although he was a masterful tactician, this book illustrates that with multiple battles--boring! It takes a map to keep up. As the book points out, there is little known about his childhood. Then, the author spends about a half hour talking about his time at the US Military Academy, Spanish American war and another half hour talking about his professorship at VMI. Good discussions, all. When Davis dives into the civil war, the book was only 25% finished. I knew that it would be a long slog to the end--5 hours or so. Davis doesn't apply the lessons learned earlier to his civil war service, very well; this book did little to contribute to my knowledge of the man. There was a bit of analysis at the end. The reader can skip over about five hours, right to that. While he was among the greatest tacticians the USA has ever seen, let us not forget, Thomas Jackson was a traitor to his country.",
            "The numbers listed as soldiers is astronomical. Stonewall was able to beat armies much larger than his. It seemed like he was a soldier just like his men. He never seemed to sleep much and was always thinking of the next skirmish.He seemed to be such a Christian man and many of the soldiers attended church because he did. He also seemed devoted to his family. What a shame he didn't get to spend much time with his infant daughter.Had he lived I still believe he would have made a difference in that bloody war. At the very least it would have lasted longer. It is amazing that his tactics are still study and used today.Another thing that interested me was the communication during that time. How in the world could you win if you can't communicate with those in charge. Also how he relied on a Mapper to help him with the topo around them. Hodgkiss was quite a helper for him in winning the battles.",
            "Very nice summary of Stonewall Jackson's career. I'd of course known who he was but didn't really have a context to tie him to. This book does a nice job of describing his background and upbringing and tying it to his Civil War exploits. With the amazing success he had in the beginning of the war, it really makes you wonder what would've happened if he hadn't died of wounds received at Chancellorsville."

            "Late one night",
            "The Bunyip of Berkeley's Creek by Jenny Wagner, illustrated by Ron Brooks is a gentle, humorous story of prejudice, identity and self-acceptance about a mythological Australian creature.Brooks' illustrations are reminiscent at times of Sendak, using a dark engraving style that suits this story well. My favorite images are the cover, passing platypus, lost in thought, chasing the emu, quiet billabong, billy on to boil, and the last two pictures.This is a great story about identity, prejudice, and self acceptance. Seeing other Australian animals is a plus, though they are verbally cruel to the bunyip. I was fortunate to see, and use in storytimes, this book in the late 1980's when it was part of an Australian Children's Book exhibit that was displayed at the public library where I then worked. Its been a picture book favorite of mine ever since and I'm very happy to revisit it as part of the Magical Creatures discussion in the Goodreads Picture Book Club for April 2012. Highly recommended for school & public library collections. My library system had just one copy in its 70 plus branches.For ages 4 to 7, australian, bush, animals, prejudice, identity, self-acceptance, peer, support, humor and fans of Jenny Wagner and Ron Brooks.",
            "The Bunyip of Berkeley\u2019s Creek is a story of self-discovery, of not being confined by the perceptions of others. To summarise: a creature emerges from the black mud of a creek. As it scrapes off the mud it asks itself: \u201cWhat am I?\u201d As quick as Cary Young buzzing in to answer the same question of Tony Barber, a platypus answers: \u201cYou are a bunyip\u201d. The bunyip goes around asking other animals what he looks like. \u201cHorrible,\u201d says a wallaby. \u201cHorrible,\u201d says an emu.The bunyip finds a man, a scientist of sorts, who tells him that bunyips don\u2019t look like anything because bunyips simply don\u2019t exist. At first the man doesn\u2019t even look up from his notebook, where a bunyip is existing right there in front of him. But like a typical stubborn human being, the man knows what he knows, and won\u2019t be told otherwise.But the bunyip remains cheerfully optimistic. He goes off someplace quiet where he can be as handsome as he likes, on his own, away from those who will only bring him down. He looks at himself with a little mirror \u2013 an obvious metaphor for finding oneself instead of relying on the opinions of others \u2013 and seems happy enough. He\u2019s even happier when a lady bunyip emerges from the swamp, and he shares his mirror with her.Though it wasn\u2019t familiar to me, The Bunyip of Berkeley\u2019s Creek was a collaboration between the same author and illustrator who created one of my childhood favourites: John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat. Author Jenny Wagner wrote the story, with all its existential angst, and illustrator Ron Brooks added his earthy style, creating an atmosphere distinctly Australian but not clich\u00e9d. As a result, the book feels timeless.And yet it was very much of a time. Published in 1973, Bunyip came out shortly after the progressive Gough Whitlam was elected Australia\u2019s new prime minister, ending 23 years of conservative rule. The bunyip\u2019s \u201cWhat am I?\u201d refrain struck a chord with Brooks, who sensed the entire country collectively asking a similar question. As a result, the tall and imposing Whitlam was one of the models Brooks used to design his bunyip.The other was a fascinating individual named Haworth Bartram. You\u2019re unlikely to have heard of Haworth Bartram, so let me fill you in. His name was familiar to me from researching an upcoming blog entry on a curious Australian book called Monty Mouse Looks for Adventure. What makes it so peculiar is that the illustrations are not drawings but photographs \u2013 photographs of a taxidermied mouse posed in various ways to fit the story.Haworth Bartram was the photographer. Not only that, he was the publisher. A very wealthy former importer who never married and lived with his elderly mother in Heidelberg, Bartram was a keen photographer who believed that illustrating books with drawings was old-fashioned, and photos were the way of the future. So he started a photography studio/publishing company called Childerset, more or less to produce his own work.And Jenny Wagner worked for him as project director. So when Wagner wrote The Bunyip of Berkeley\u2019s Creek and took it to Bartram, he realised photographs wouldn\u2019t work. Bunyips, despite the message of Wagner\u2019s text, do not exist. So Brooks was brought in, but struggled at first to work out how his bunyip should look. Eventually he modelled it on Bartram. And here is how Brooks, in his fascinating memoir Drawn from the Heart, described Bartram:Well over six feet tall, with a large equatorial circumference, he resembled nothing so much as a balloon, one of those pear-shaped water balloons you drop from the verandah roof onto some unsuspecting little brother or sister ... Not much neck to speak of ... And because he had no waist, he wore braces \u2013 over the shoulders, crossed at the back and clipped to his pants to hold them up.Haworth Bartram sounds like a very odd individual indeed \u2013 Brooks describes the way he rarely saw Bartram consume anything other than Arnott\u2019s Scotch Finger biscuits and bottles of orange Fanta. And much as I would like to see a photo of him, the only one I can find online is a grainy digitised newspaper picture of him as a young boy. Further googling reveals that he died in 1985 at the age of 62.But Brooks\u2019 description of him sounds very much like the bunyip star of our book \u2013 although because Brooks was nervous about making his bunyip too much like Bartram, he threw in a little bit of Whitlam as well. In any case, the end result was a character that has charmed generations of Australian children.As an illustrator, Brooks certainly has a characteristic style, featuring lots of cross-hatching and linework to create the appearance of texture. And as an author, Wagner too is distinctive, dealing with questions of existence, identity and prejudice, and layering her work with symbolism that adults might understand, while children will just enjoy a good story.https://dadreads.blogspot.com.au/2016...",
            "Every Aussie kids knows the story, and it lives in our childhood hearts. Re-reading it again as an adult I reserve the right to be a little more critical - but I can't. It's still a quiet lovely tale of someone feeling completely out of place, where no one understands, and yet - we can always find someone ... somewhere ... like us.The illustrations by Ron Brooks remind me of Georges Seurat, though with short strokes rather than dots of colour.I saw this a few years back as a puppet play (large scale) in Perth.Note: The bunyip, or kianpraty, is a mythical creature from Australian aboriginal legend said to lurk in billabongs, water holes, creeks. A billabong is a small oxbow lake - a water hole.",
            "Kind of an interesting story that I hoped would go somewhere. I think kids can identify with the Bunyip as he seeks to understand himself. After all, kids spend their childhoods and teenage years (and maybe even their 20s?) trying to do the same. Unfortunately, I think this was a rather weak ending to a compelling little story. I feel like I missed the point.",
            "Peque\u00f1o cuento existencialista sobre el reconocimiento de la propia diferencia. El final bien heteronormado, me he dado cuenta de que los cuentos infantiles suelen tener una moraleja bien simple de ''el amor [con una mujer] lo puede todo'' que desvirt\u00faa todo el texto, pero meh: las ilustraciones son muy, muy buenas.",

            "Ok, read. I am not impressed, I feel like it took forever to get through this book! I am taking a break before moving into the next series. ",
            "My My My My My....What a Group of Ladies. As Promised here's my review of the Crew-The PotLuck Club Crew!!! .......And a general overall synopsis at the end to wrap things up.....Let's get started, Shall we???I'm going to start with Ms. Queen President herself *Evangeline Benson-Vesey*- What a lady!!! BUT what a lady scorned and holding on the past, which she did for 2/3 of the books in the series. I mean grade-school/childhood age is a LONG-TIME to be harboring hate and envy against somebody....HOWEVER who she was harboring feelings for was one to be hated. Dee-Dee/aka Doreen, well who does that to their child? She was a piece of work, but I think after Evangeline eventually got over herself. I did like her progression over the course of the book. From the situation with her niece Leigh, the way their prayer meetings were run and how she handled Lisa LeeAnn, grief over her best friend, and going to face her grave, to HOW she eventually handled her almost double engagement and accepting her first and probably ONLY love back into her life; it was good to see the Evangeline that she SHOULD have been all along come forth. Forgiveness goes a long way in how we view ourselves",
            "Like the first two books, this too has the complete spread: funny quips, moving scenes, family, friends, reunions and reconciliations, realizations, change - all presented with the central theme of the power of prayer. Of course, there are the recipes!Such a fitting ending to this three-book series where life for the potluck members are all looking up. I read all three books one after the other, and I wish they were longer, not so much because it was lacking but because I just wanted more. Yes, and more there is! Where else will a group of potluckers head to but the food business, and that too is where I'm headed: the potluck catering club!",
            "Another great book! I'm sure glad I'm reading these after all the books are out because they definitely leave you hanging at the end. Now to hold on two days until the next one gets to me. And I've changed my mind who I want Donna to end up with ;) it's obvious now! (Hope I'm not wrong) ",
            "It is a gossipy insipid story with God references thrown-in to make it Christian. Not the worst thing I have ever read. ",
            "This is a story about life in a town called Summit View, which is told by a collection of multiple points of view, mostly from the women there, and the unique concept was the frosting on the cake. If this book incorporated less religion, I think I would have enjoyed the book more because I like reading books with plot, not about religion, because then I can just go read the Bible or some other religious book. Overall, I liked the book a lot.",
            "Another fun read ! Nothing deep that I have to ponder about. It's a quick easy book to read and enjoy without having to think too much. I'm so glad I got the whole Pot Luck Club series and can read them in order...",
            "All's Well That Ends WellSadness today as this series ends. Want more. A story of lasting friendships with love enduring through the rough times and added laughter during the good times. Enjoyable, light reading. The best book of the series."

",
            "Nine chapters of animal ghosts (usually a beloved pet) compose this page turner of a book. Although a few of the chapters are sad, almost all reflect the love between a young pet owner and the pet. This would be engaging and appropriate reading for age 8 on up to young adult. ",
            "My rating on this might be skewed, since I lost two dogs within the last six months. One in surgery the other to old age. The stories are short good for 2nd to 5th graders. Some may make you cry other will help with morals. Some read as urban legends. ",
            "Allan Zullo\u2019s \u201cHaunted Pets\u201d from 1995 most certainly has an effect. Animals are equals. Our wonderful cats are sons and daughters. This collection might have been one of two types: unserious, with spookiness as the goal, or containing encouraging testimonies about loved ones staying near us after death; uplifting and healing. It was definitely not the trivial former but not quite the latter. That\u2019s one reason these compelling, heavily emotional accounts get four-star feedback. I am accustomed to these non-fiction presentations starting with the ghost. I was unprepared to be shown their origins: pets\u2019 family life prior to death. I\u2019m not someone who gets through those sorts of subjects without great unease.Another reason for a star reduction is that two stories were unpleasant; not in heartbreaking reaction to sadness but because they were awful. In one, children overlooked a dog. He befell accidents through their irresponsibility and died. They professed guilt but no further than \u201cWhat a shame\u201d. This sweet, eager, forgiving, loving dog who was taken for granted to his peril, might have been requited and felt appreciated if they at last realized: he was a sweet, eager, forgiving, loving dog! I was outraged those parents weren\u2019t devastated enough either and hadn\u2019t stepped in.Allan\u2019s compilation was more personal than anticipated, showing the days when families received bad news, or taking us through the cause of their pet\u2019s end. His presentation isn\u2019t without emotional power. Angling it from the very perspective I\u2019m not constructed to experience comfortably, means I couldn\u2019t rightly declare I enjoyed it. It isn\u2019t for lack of excellent work but because I am empathic, especially sensitive about animals. This book is wholly worthwhile. Likely there are other readers who could get a hearty cry out of this and stoically enjoy this fine selection of stories."

            "Name: Malek Sibai Date: Jan/25/16Section: 7-3Good Reads #3 First Encyclopedia of Science  This enthusiastic book First Encyclopedia of Science written by Rachel Firth has many interesting facts about science that I never newed. The book starts with a great introduction that explains what is Science and what is useful about science in people\u2019s life. When the reader reads the introduction they have two or three things that they just learned. I just learned that people can make experiments on animals which some people will never think of doing it. \u201cScientists have found 17 different species (types) of macaws in the wild\u201d (Firth 4). Science is also examining people or animal bodies which are kind of rare if someone wants to the an experiment that will inspire them. In first pages of the book, it was taking about the outer space. They were naming the different Planets in the Galaxy. They had many cooled facts that could surprise the reader like our Galaxy has 200 billion of starts which means that the Universe had way more and than 200 billion. It also scientifically proved that if humans take a plane it will take more than two million years to get out of our Galaxy. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s just a small part Universe, the Milky Way is enormous. The world\u2019s fastest plane would take about two million tears to fly across it\u201d (Firth 8). The book made it much interesting when the reader reaches to the seasons because it tells the reader the all the seasons. The book explains that the earth is tilted and spins on its axis which the reason why certain places experience different seasons than other places. For example, when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere means that it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. \u201cIn June, direct sunlight hits the northern hemisphere and it\u2019s summer there. In the south, it\u2019s winter\u201d (Firth 12). These are the interesting facts in the enthusiastic book First Encyclopedia of Science written by Rachel Firth. First Encyclopedia of Science is the most interesting, life story, and useful book I ever had. First Encyclopedia of Science is one of the most interesting books because it teaches people facts that people will never know in the extraordinary world of Science. For example, one interesting fact in the book First Encyclopedia of Science is the Raindrops who create different colors of the rainbow. The raindrops make different colors of the rainbow by splitting the-the sunlight colors into many sections. \u201cSometimes it rains even though the Sun is shining. Raindrops split sunlight into different colors. When this happens you might see a rainbow. From the ground, it arches, but from an aircraft, it may be a circle\u201d (Firth 15). Another evidence that First Encyclopedia of Science is one of the most interesting books in the world of Science is because it can also teach different things in the world. For instance, the book can teach people how does new lives has growth like the animals making babies and plants producing new plants. \u201cLiving things can make new living things. These live on after their parents have died. Animals make babies, and plants produce new plants. As they get older, most living things grow and change. Some animals give birth to live babies. Penguins, like other birds, lay eggs with the babies inside\u201d (Firth 16). First Encyclopedia of Science is a life lesson book because it teaches you why did something happen. For example, when there is a tornado and it breaks a house the book will have the answer for what causes the tornado to happen. \u201cWhen it\u2019s windy, it\u2019s because the air is moving around. You can\u2019t see it blowing leaves around and feel it on your face. A gentle wind is a breeze. It can help dry wet clothes. Gales are much stronger winds. They can blow tiles off roofs. Hurricanes are very strong winds that can do a lot of damage\u201d (Firth 15). First Encyclopedia of Science is a useful book because it gives people ideas to make something. For instance, the book could be helpful for people when the reader reads the book and finds out an experiment that they can do for a Science fair. \u201cMake gas You can make carbon dioxide gas and blow up a balloon with it. You will need a narrow-necked jar; some baking soda; some vinegar; a balloon; a teaspoon. 1. Fill a quarter if the jar with vinegar. Put the soda into the balloon, using the teaspoon. 2. Stretch the neck of the balloon over the top of the-the jar. Don\u2019t let any soda spill into the jar. 3. Quickly lift the balloon up to tip all of the soda into the jar. The vinegar will react with the soda, making bubbles. When the vinegar and soda react (see page 37), they make carbon dioxide gas which fills the balloon, blowing it up a little. (Firth 35). That the reason why First Encyclopedia of Science is the most interesting, life story, and useful book I ever had. First Encyclopedia of Science is an enthusiastic book that makes Science much more interesting. \u201cHow do you know that this book is nonfiction I know this book is a nonfiction book because it tells real facts most of the Scientists know. For example people's body moves by the muscular system helping the body move around. \u201cThe bones of your skeleton are moved by muscles. These help you move in all kinds of ways, from walking or swimming to playing the recorder or using a computer. You also have other muscles (in your heart, for example) that work without you even thinking about them\u201d (Firth 27). \u201cList five facts you learned from this book?\u201d My first fact that I learned in the book is the Raindrops who create different colors of the rainbow. The raindrops make different colors of the rainbow by splitting the-the sunlight colors into many sections. \u201cSometimes it rains even though the Sun is shining. Raindrops split sunlight into different colors. When this happens you might see a rainbow. From the ground, it arches, but from an aircraft, it may be a circle\u201d (Firth 15). My second fact that I learned in the book is how animals and plants make new babies. For instance, the book can teach people how does new lives has growth like the animals making babies and plants producing new plants. \u201cLiving things can make new living things. These live on after their parents have died. Animals make babies, and plants produce new plants. As they get older, most living things grow and change. Some animals give birth to live babies. Penguins, like other birds, lay eggs with the babies inside\u201d (Firth 16). My fourth fact that I learned in the book is your brain controls all directs all of your body including the five senses. \u201cYour Brain controls your body. Your five senses - sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell - tell your brain what\u2019s going on around you, so it can make decisions\u201d (Firth 30). My fifth fact that I learned in this book is in the world everything is made out of atoms. \u201cEverything is made out of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms can join together in groups called molecules\u201d (Firth 32). These are why First Encyclopedia of Science is an enthusiastic book. ",
            "This book is good for first and second graders. This book educates on anything to do with science. Children can turn to any section if they are having difficulty with a topic in class. Plants, bones, and seasons are a few of the topics that are mentioned. I like this book for children to read because science could be difficult to understand. If a child wants to continue their education on a matter or learn something different they can. The pictures assist in chidren's understanding if they do not understand the words. This book could be used to introduce science topics in the classroom. Students who are also science oriented can read this book as their independent reading book. ",
            "An absolutely brilliant book and NOT just for kids, things are explained in such simple ways I think adults would also find this interesting as opposed to all the technical jargon used for text books.Cells, atoms, plants, magnets, weather, animals, chemicals and many other topics are covered alongside colour drawings, diagrams and photographs to emphasise points.",
            "Fascinating facts in this book. I find most science boring but I love how Usborne makes it bite size for easier learning.",
            "Excellent little book to cover a variety of science topics on a simple level. I would say this is an excellent little book for the 6-8 year old range. I have this book in the mini version so it's compact and my kids can easily pack it around.",
            "Love the detail in this book. Some great information ",
            "The children really enjoyed the illustrations. Full of information on specific science topics. We used this as part of our homeschool curriculum.",
            "My kids really liked this book. "

        "description": "Cruise into murder, mayhem, and alternate realities.Award-winning author Pat Murphy takes us aboard a luxury cruise ship and into the strange confluence of time and space known as the Bermuda Triangle, in an engaging science fiction romp that recalls the work of Kate Wilhelm.Susan Galina and her friend Pat have escaped their normal lives into the elegant, isolated world of the Odyssey, a luxury cruise ship heading from NY to Europe via Bermuda. Pat is working on her doctoral thesis in quantum physics, and Susan is recovering from a recent and unhappy divorce.To Susan's delight, she discovers that her favorite author, Max Merriwell, is also aboard ship, teaching writers' workshop. Susan's life becomes even more interesting when she meets Tom Clayton, the handsome chief of security. This cruise looks very promising indeed.But the pleasant shipboard vacation turns dark as the Odyssey passes into the Bermuda Triangle. Each year, Max Merriwell writes three novels: a science fiction novel under his own name, a fantasy novel under the pseudonym Mary Maxwell, and a mystery novel under the pseudonym Weldon Merrimax. The trouble begins when Max receives a threatening note that appears to come from Weldon Merrimax, Max's own pseudonym.

            "Unabridged. Read by Johanna Ward.Blurb: Cruise into murder, mayhem, and alternate realities. Award-winning author Pat Murphy takes us aboard a luxury cruise ship and into the strange confluence of time and space known as the Bermuda Triangle, in an engaging science-fiction romp that recalls the work of Kate Wilhelm. Susan Galina and her friend Pat have escaped their normal lives into the elegant, isolated world of the Odyssey, a luxury cruise ship heading from New York to Europe via Bermuda. Pat is working on her doctoral thesis in quantum physics, and Susan is recovering from a recent and unhappy divorce. To Susan\u2019s delight, she discovers that her favorite author, Max Merriwell, is also aboard ship, teaching a writers\u2019 workshop. Susan\u2019s life becomes even more interesting when she meets Tom Clayton, the handsome chief of security. This cruise looks very promising indeed. But the pleasant shipboard vacation turns dark as the Odyssey passes into the Bermuda Triangle. Each year, Max Merriwell writes three novels, a science-fiction novel under his own name, a fantasy novel under the pseudonym Mary Maxwell, and a mystery novel under the pseudonym Weldon Merrimax. The trouble begins when Max receives a threatening note that appears to come from Weldon Merrimax, Max\u2019s own pseudonym. Susan hears wolves howling in the night, the ship\u2019s passengers are seized with a dancing mania, and monsters lurk in the ship\u2019s corridors. An eyewitness reports a murder - but the victim of the crime is not on the passenger list and the body is nowhere to be found. While others struggle to understand these strange events, Pat seeks the explanation in quantum theory. This starts out like Love Boat Does Bermuda Triangle - hope it gets better!LATER: ::just:can't:do:this::",

            "True Rating: 4.5/5David enjoyed reading this book even more than I enjoyed writing this review I'm about to write. The review discussed the depth of the characters, from the heavily-backstoried protagonist to the well-described supporting characters, and the consistent geography of the setting - that is, the landmarks on the cruise ship. It also gave great reflection to David's ready acceptance of a story and fictional structure so meta that a cyclically-referential review is to this book as this review is to the review I'm writing.Ha, I hope you're confused :D. Overall, just a smidge off perfect, but exciting, engrossing, and has the exact effect intended. ",

            "The Bible Unearthed is a rich informative book that manages to deliver a large amount of detail in a highly readable prose that entertains without overwhelming the reader.The book focuses on the archaeology of the Bronze Age and Iron Age Levant and traces the story that this archaeology unfolds as compared with the accounts given in the Hebrew Bible. Despite the subject matter, however, the authors do not appear to have any particular axe to grind and would seem to be more interested in discussing what the current evidence tells us (or, in many cases, merely suggests to us) rather than trying to make it fit any particular pet theory about the history of the Levant.While the authors do (convincingly) argue that the archaeological record reveals a history of the Biblical kingdoms of Israel and Judah that often departs from the accounts given in the Deuteronomistic history, they do not present this information as part of any agenda to debunk or rebut the Bible - at least, not beyond the acknowledgment that there is really no evidence to support a strictly literal interpretation of the historical information provided in the Bible. As the authors note in closing: the Bible's integrity and",
            "This book would be better known and more controversial if it was not so dry in its presentation. Basically it says that there is no archaeological evidence to support the Biblical story of the birth of the Jewish faith--which, of course, knocks the pins out from under Christianity and Islam as well, since all three great world religions essentially look to the Old Testament and believe in the same God. Whether one believes or disbelieves the premise, this is fascinating stuff for anyone interested in the history of religion.",
            "When reading the Bible, you're not engaging in an activity 'normal people' do with their 'normal books.' The Bible isn't normal. It's an enigma. It's something out of place in our time, out of context. Produced in a literary world unlike our own, it's not strictly history and not strictly fiction. The challenge of understanding which is which, or when and why it was written is pretty well insurmountable with the helping hand of modern archaeology, but a damned nightmare without it. Archaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman have put their heads together to provide the common man a survey of recent findings on the historicity of the Old Testament. What they have to offer is probably not a shock to scholars in the field, but it will be a fundamentalist nut shot. The picture of ancient Israel is different today than it was to us even a hundred years ago, and vastly different than the world the Bible portrays. Having dispensed with the fantastic legends of wandering wilderness hordes fleeing Egypt and lighting military campaigns through Canaan, the actual history of Israel unfolds very differently when looked at through the ruins.Finkelstein and Silberman present firm challenges to more generally accepted popular notions. There is no evidence to suggest that a mass exodus of Hebrew slaves two million strong piled into Canaan one day (as it would have come as quite a surprise to the string of Egyptian army fortifications already in the country at the time). In fact, it seems now that what became Israel emerged naturally out of the existing population. Further on, if David ruled from Jerusalem, he did so from what amounted to little more than a hilltop village, later transformed in the minds of Judahite authors into the seat of a United Monarchy. And the monotheism it represented was more likely a later development around the time the Torah was being composed.These and other iconoclastic revelations weave together 'Archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts.' There still debate to be had on various topics, and those debates are happening, but in order to appreciate the biblical narrative, knowing its historical context\u2013\u2013its real historical context\u2013\u2013is invaluable. The Bible Unearthed is not an overly challenging read. Written for an audience not already versed in biblical history or scholarship, it presents the biblical version of events and then attempts to address the level of accuracy\u2013\u2013which differs throughout\u2013\u2013with the help of archaeological findings. Finkelstein and Silberman draw on a wealth of sources from the ancient Near East, illuminating their theories with the best evidence available. The whole truth may never be known about any ancient civilization, but through science we can glimpse that world, and hopefully then come to a better understanding of it.",
            "Authors Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman examine archaeological evidence in an effort to shine further light on the writing and creation of the first five books of the old testament of the Bible or the Pentateuch.From a historical perspective, this book was fascinating to me.Recent developments in archaeology have finally allowed us to bridge the gap between the study of biblical texts and the archaeological finds. We can now see that the Bible is - along with distinctive pottery forms",
            "This has been a fascinating excursion into the ancient history of Israel, Judah and the emergence of the Jewish people as an identifiable group who emerged from all the peoples of Canaan. Matching the archaeological record with the historical narratives of the bible, the authors show that much of what the so-called Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism itself) hold as central stories of creation, settlement, exile and Exodus from Egypt were written in about the 7th century BC and wove together myth, oral history and doctrine to support the Jewish state of Judah. The great buildings of David and Solomon referred to in the Bible do not date from the eras at which those kings probably lived, but from periods of Assyrian occupation. There is no evidence of early enslavement in Egypt at the time it was supposed to happen, and no evidence of the conquest of Canaan by the Jews after Moses, And so on.Finkelstein and Silberman are deeply interested in the emergence of an identifiable Jewish culture in something like its modern form - and this dates to the written codification of the Pentateuch and in particular the Deuteronomic histories of the 7th century BC.They end the main part of the book (there are extensive appendices) by saying that 'the Bible's integrity and, in fact, its historicity, not not depend on any particular proof of any of its particular events or personalities. ... the power of the biblical saga stems from its being a compelling and coherent narrative expression of the timeless theme of a people's liberation",
            "Bible plus archaeology equals a rip-snortin' romp through centuries of dogma, tradition, and guesstimations writ in stone. No axes to grind to be found here, but if you're a Literalist, this probably isn't for you. Most others will learn a lot.",
            "This book was quite interesting. It compared the history of Israel from the Scriptures to archaeological evidence and known writings of the time. It theorizes that some of the stories in the Bible are actually metaphors and compares the stories to what was actually happening at around the estimated time of the writing of the Books of Moses. It also theorizes that since some of what the Bible states regarding Israel/Judah does not match up with archaeological evidence, that it was more of an idealized version of what they wanted based on local legends and kingly ambitions. If you are interested in history and archaeology, I recommend that you read this book. ",
            "For a born again Atheist, this was priceless... great read and certainly puts things into perspective",
            "This was a really smooth read \u2013\u00a0beautifully and concisely written. I've been a fan for some years of Werner Keller's The Bible as History, and it still has a lot of good material on the archaeology of the Bible. But Finkelstein and Silberman take the scholarship into the 21st century. A tremendous amount of archaeology has been done in Israel since Keller's book was written (1960s) and last revised (early 1980s). This allows Finkelstein and Silberman to overturn many of Keller's conclusions, and provide definitive answers to many of the core mysteries about the Old Testament. Did the Patriarchs exist? Who were the first Israelites and where did they come from? Did the Exodus really happen? Did Joshua actually invade and conquer Canaan? Were Solomon and David great kings who ruled a powerful and united Kingdom of Israel? And most important: Why was the Bible written? And when? Whose interests was it meant to further? All these topics are addressed, and settled in a very convincing way. Apparently, there has been some controversy about the conclusions of this book, and I'd like to read some of those criticisms to get a more rounded view. But if you are interested in the Old Testament, this book will transform your view of it, and take your insight to a much deeper level. ",
            "First published in 2001, Archaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman's fine book will challenge people with an orthodox view of the Bible because, as the archaeological record shows, many of the events recorded in it,did not take place quite as the narrative says.As Finkelstein and Silberman \u2013 both archaeologists \u2013 show, the archaeological record tells a very different story from the traditionally accepted one. Their story is more believable and, as it turns out, more accurate than the orthodox view of the Bible is historically pretty accurate, and events like Joshua\u2019s battle against Jericho, the Exodus, and the great kingdoms of David and Solomon were true. Archaeology shows that they could not be, because there is no record of them where and when there should be.\u201cThe power of the biblical saga,\u201d they write \u201celoquently expresses the deeply rooted sense of shared origins, experiences, and destiny that every human community needs in order to survive\u201d (page 318). The biblical saga is woven together from myth, folktale, origin and hero stories, songs and poetry from different times creating a story that met the political needs of specific times. \u201cThe authors and editors of the Deuteronomistic History and parts of the Pentateuch gathered and reworked the most precious traditions of the people of Israel to gird the nation for the great national struggle that lay ahead\u201d (page 283). What was needed was \u201ca great national epic of liberation for all the tribes of Israel, against a great and domineering pharaoh, whose realm was uncannily similar to its geographical details to that of\u201d pharaoh Pammetichus, who reigned during the 7th century BCE.The archaeological record shows conclusively that the great events of Hebrew history (the Exodus, the origins of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob/Yaakov, the great kingdoms of David and Solomon) did not happen as written, and that there was no place in geography called \u201cEden\u201d where God once wandered in the forest. Biblical history \u201cwas not history writing in the modern sense. It was a composition simultaneously ideological and theological\u201d (page 284). In other words, the Deuteronomistic History and the Bible itself are compilations woven together over time to tell the religious and cultural story of a people, much in the way that the Popul Vuh (Book of the People) \u2013 a collection of mythistorical narratives of the Post Classic Quich\u00e9 kingdom in Guatemala's western highlands \u2013 were collected.This is not a point of view that will go down well with fundamentalists who insist on making science conform to their literalistic reading of the Bible as accurate history. But it makes the Bible \u2013 these ancient stories \u2013 more acceptable to people like me because it makes the narrative more real and \u201ctrue\u201d as myths are \u201ctrue\u201d. And in ancient times, myth and factual events were more often interwoven than not. George Washington, for instance, didn\u2019t have to actually chopped down a cherry tree for me to understand the \u201ctruth\u201d of the story \u2013 that George Washington could be trusted because, when asked about the tree, he told the truth.Reading the Bible this way, it is easy to place various parts of the narrative within their historic context (such as specific dress and dietary rules) rather than having to see them as truths-for-all-time-and-all-people, as the literalists see them. I found the book both fascinating and a joy to read.",
            "Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, Finkelstein works in his low chronology without preface",
            "Convincing presentation by two Israeli scholars of the lack of archeological evidence supporting the Bible as an historical account, and the large amount of evidence contradicting the Biblical account of history. The authors' hypothesis of the Biblical account's origins and motives is separate from this overwhelming amount of data pointing to the Bible as largely historical fiction.",
            "Dr. Finkelstein sure whipped up some controvery with this book - but you gotta give the guy credit for looking at something so ancient under a new lens.",
            "Thanks to the archaeological findings of recent decades, we now know a lot more about the historicity of the Bible than we did 50 years ago. The Patriarchs seem to have never existed, and the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan never to have taken place; the stories about them are full of anachronisms that make sense only around the 7th century BCE: domesticated camels, Egypt fearing an invasion from the east, Edom being a kingdom, Joseph being sold to traders in Arabian goods. Imagine a ballad set in Kievan Rus where Ilya Muromets smokes tobacco and battles Crimean Tatars! The original Hebrews seem to have been hilltop pastoralists who were not ethnically distinct from lowlander Canaanites; their garbage pits contain no pig bones, which means that they did not eat pork; modern Jews who do not eat pork follow a very ancient archeologically attested tradition. There has in fact been a kingdom of Judah ruled by the dynasty of David, and a much richer kingdom of Israel ruled by the dynasty of Omri, which engaged in building projects rivaled only by the building projects of Herod the Great almost a thousand years later; there is no evidence that the two were ever politically unified. In the late 8th century BCE, the Assyrian Empire conquered Israel and deported a minority of its residents elsewhere; it conquered most of Judah, besieged Jerusalem but did not take it. Around 100 years later the Assyrian Empire collapsed, King Josiah of Judah decided to expand into the former kingdom of Israel, and needed an ideological-theological justification for this; it was at his court that the Deuteronomist decided to prevent the falsification of history to the detriment of Judah's interests, and assembled old stories about patriarchs, chiefs and kings into the more-or-less coherent narrative that we now know as the Hebrew Bible.",
            "The authors of The Bible Unearthed successfully collate new findings and information that has been known for awhile to present clear and concise rethinking of The Old Testament at the time of kings and Biblical archaeology in general. Once the confirmation bias of the Bible in one hand and a trowel in the other has been removed,and modern scientific techniques applied, the Old Testament can be set in the context of politics and nation building rather than a history in the traditional sense.The authors themselves characterise the book as :our attempt to formulate a new archaeological vision of ancient Israel in which the Bible is one of the most important artifacts and cultural achievements [but] not the unquestioned narrative framework into which every archaeological find must be fit. Well worth reading.",
            "Only 14 reviews? Well let's make it 15.This book was a real eye opener to me.So much of the old testament is a myth!He presents the hard earned evidence most convincently. There was no patriarchs,no Israelite bondage in Egypt,nor a mass exodus out of Egypt either. Also the Jews came from theCanaanites! Most were pagan worshippers because they were a tribe of the Canaanites that laterseparated themselves. I wonder how many fundamentalists dare to read this great?! I double-dare them to read.lol!",

",
            "Good intro to a particular view of the real history behind the bible (up to the return from the Babylonian exile). Summary-ish- Most of the major stories that happened before 800-700BC contain many significant historical errors that make it clear that they're written from a later context - sometimes it's likely the errors are intentional to create a greater parallel with the current story of Judah, other times it's simply ignorance (eg the story of Abraham is attempting to write about a pastoral history but includes camels which didn't exist for hundreds of years afterwards)- Therefore the patriarchs didn't exist, at least not in the story the bible suggests. Parts may have been based on folk tales - The Exodus didn't happen. There's no evidence of anything even vaguely like it and Egypt controlled the areas the Israelites supposedly escaped to the whole time period anyway. It's possible there was an initial basis in particular anti-Egypt experiences due to the occupation and certain conflicts (eg the Hyksos and Apiru) but the story itself is fiction.- The Israelites were always Canaanites and although the circumstances of the initial separation are murky the bible's insistence on total division is nonsense. Interestingly our first evidence of Israelite cultural separation is the lack of pig bones in their refuse in the ~1200s BC- There was no invasion as portrayed in Joshua - most of the places supposed to have been destroyed were either destroyed much earlier or later than the timeframe the story demands. Jericho was settled at the time but was a small settlement with no walls. - The bible is incredibly biased against Israel, which was far richer and more powerful than Judah. Because it's written retrospectively after the Assyrian destruction of Israel it's easy for the authors to present any successes of Israel as a temporary reprieve while the trading and cosmopolitanism that made them wealthy is used as a reason for their destruction, because they didn't keep their purity to God.- There was likely no United Monarchy of Israel and Judah and this was a later propaganda invention to justify Judah's dreams of conquest of Israel's former territories. If there was any sort of United Monarchy it had a very limited territory.- The golden age of Solomon is a total myth. Archaeology makes clear things that were previously attributed to Solomon were mostly the product of Israel's Omride dynasty, who were rich and involved in many building projects across a large territory. The Solomonide golden age is again a later propaganda creation likely based on the stories of the great wealth and trade that Israel experienced before the Assyrian destruction (and possibly partly the new status as a wealthier nation Judah gained as an Assyrian vassal on a major trading route during Josiah's reign)- The first 5 books of the bible and the whole Deuteronomic history of Joshua, Samuel and Kings was likely first compiled in the reign of King Josiah. Most of the historical details in it match up to that era and the whole narrative is presenting Josiah as an ideal messianic character who'll finally restore a great kingdom through devotion to God, who always rewards the truly faithful. Later, there were edits that changed the emphasis somewhat to the holiness of the whole *nation* of Israel to recover from his unceremonious death in an obscure meeting with an Egyptian army, paving the way both for the dominance of the priesthood as well as helping retain the faith among the whole people even after the major losses. (Worth nothing he only touches on the composition of the Pentateuch in general, which is fair, because it's an absurdly complicated subject)- The Babylonian Captivity only carried away a small percentage of people, not even all the upper classes, but they later were able to impose their particular views of worship and pure identity on those who remained due to being backed by the power of the Persians. There's obviously stuff in this book that's hotly contested - history always is and especially stuff like this",

Desde que tengo memoria siempre me ense\u00f1aron que la Biblia no era un libro de historia. Seamos honestos, aveces me encuentro con argumentos que cuestionan mi fe, pero si la deportaci\u00f3n Babil\u00f3nica del pueblo de Jud\u00e1 fue total o parcial, o si fueron 10mil o 70mil deportados... me trae muy sin cuidado. En ese sentido el trabajo en este libro planteado me parece excelente. Es muy respetuoso, consistente, elaborado, y detallado. Es un tema muy interesante. Aprend\u00ed much\u00edsimo sobre la historia del pueblo de Israel, y creo que me va a venir bien para entender otras cosas. No s\u00e9 si ponerle cinco estrellas porque no me entretuvo tanto por momentos, y porque la arqueolog\u00eda siempre me deja ese sabor amargo de encontrarme con lo poco que sabemos sobre el pasado... digo, incre\u00edble todo lo que se puede descifrar de un par de piedras, pero tanto queda en el imaginario que es casi un relato de ficci\u00f3n. Creo que a partir de este libro por primera vez tengo una idea m\u00e1s armadita desde Abraham hasta Jes\u00fas: - Abram sale de Ur hacia la tierra que Dios le prometi\u00f3.- Tiene dos hijos, el de la promesa (Isaac) y el otro (Ismael). - Isaac pasa a la historia por ser hijo de Abraham y padre de Jacob. - Jacob lucha con el \u00e1ngel que lo hiere y pasa a llamarse Israel.- Tiene doce hijos, uno de los cuales (Jos\u00e9) termina en Egipto vendido por sus hermanos. - Jos\u00e9 se hace un administrador muy querido e importante para los Egipcios. - Los hermanos de Jos\u00e9 se lo encuentran un d\u00eda y no lo reconocen, pero el s\u00ed a ellos. - Se reencuentran y Jos\u00e9 los recibe. (? Todo esto es muy dif\u00edcil de probar, algunos detalles claramente no coinciden)- Poco a poco (unos 300 a\u00f1os) se van convirtiendo en esclavos (? se sospecha que tal vez no eran tan esclavos).- Mois\u00e9s es un Israelita que lo cr\u00edan los Egipcios",
            "This book's thesis is that the Old Testament, though shaped by true events and traditions, was constructed in its current form as a common bond and political instrument in support of the short-lived resurgence of the kingdom Judiah and the subsequent Yahedic society that appeared after its collapse in the 7th century b.c. More hopeful archaeology from the previous 30 years was driven significantly by those who accepted the historic date range of 2100-2500 B.C. as fact and looked for supporting evidence. The authors use archaelogic evidence to refute this and form a different theory. Some of their supporting evidence is very basic. For example, while the progenitors were camel traders, camels were not found in the region until 1000 years later. It also shows how some of the oldest stories both explained the various peoples in the region and established the superiority of the Israelites (e.g. Lot's daughters as the roots to Moam and Ammon; Jacob and Esau establishing the legitimization of Israel as having bestowed the birthright). The Exodus story is explained as an explanation of how the people reached their current lands, but the actual events are judged as not fitting against the time, Egyptian span of control, or place names. The authors later argue that the Exodue story's numerous parallels to the later resurgence of Egypt demonstrate that it was the basis for people seeing what they should and can do at present. [return][return]The authors also show where archaelogy supports what we do know. For example, the highlands settlements thought to have been Isaelite indeed are the only in the are lacking pig bones. David and Solomon are portrayed as tribal chieftains sans the great empires and wealth but still of note. A slab from c. 853 mentions the destruction of the House of David Perhaps most notably in support of the political argument"

        "description": "In the summer of 2006, the NFL\u2019s most senior general manager, Ernie Accorsi, invited Tom Callahan \u201cinside\u201d the Giants organization to experience a season\u2014Accorsi\u2019s last\u2014from the front office, the locker room, the sidelines, and the tunnel. Tom made no promises, except that he\u2019d bring to the project the same fairness and thoroughness that characterized his acclaimed Unitas biography, Johnny U. The result is a remarkable book that is at once a chronicle of a tumultuous season and the story of the NFL over the last three and a half decades, told through the eyes of a man who has dedicated his life to football. The Giants started the season with high expectations, hoping to ride the talent of players like Eli Manning, Jeremy Shockey, and Tiki Barber to the Super Bowl, but the team quickly fell apart due to injuries. The GM goes far beyond the specifics of a single season, though. In a marriage of two great raconteurs, one lobbing stories and the other neatly catching them, Callahan and Accorsi\u2014writer and subject\u2014show how the pro game (and the league that showcases it) really works, and the peculiar role of today\u2019s general manager, who must be part seer, part accountant, balancing psyches and salary caps.At its essence, The GM is the story of the job\u2014of what it means to be the guy who makes the decisions . . . who\u2019s second-guessed by fans and the media . . . who must deal with endless\u2014and sometimes impossible\u2014expectations.Filled with the vivid anecdotes and storytelling that made Johnny U a surprise bestseller, The GM doesn\u2019t just illuminate. It inspires with its portrait of a consummate football-personnel strategist who, over the course of decades, gave everything to the game he loved.From the Hardcover edition.",

            "Good Topic, not the best writingI absolutely loved the topic. As a football fanatic and an aspiring GM this was the perfect book. However, for me, I need to only give it 3 stars. I think the author could have gone into more detail of the work of Accorsi and what it\u2019s like to be a GM. Also, the author often rambles in writing or seems to get away from his point. This is a great book on the 2006 NY Giants and Accorsi, but just an OK book on being a GM. ",
            "Its a good story that gives an inside look on a job that is one of the hardest in pro sports. A good book for any football fan to read.",
            "Being the General Manger of a National Football League team has to be one of the most fascinating and unique jobs. I suspect if you did a story on all 32 General Managers (some of which are also the head coach, some of which have a different title) you would end up with 32 fairly unique stories with similarity in themes. This particular book focuses on Ernie Accorsi, recently retired GM of the New York Giants.I love reading about professional football because it is fascinating to me so I did really enjoy this book, for the most part, but frankly the book is somewhat of mess. It seems the author had a lot of material and didn't quite know how to put it together.This book really is a mini-mini biography of Ernie Accorsi and a recap of the New York Giants 2006 season. The title is very misleading. It is not about the inside story of a dream job because it really does not give us a lot of inside stories about being a GM. There is really very little about the real nuts and bolts of being a GM",
            "Concerns New York football Giants' general manager Ernie Accorsi. Author followed him around during the last season of his long career. Game stories from that season are interspersed with recollections of other athletes Accorsi knew, big decisions he had made (e.g., the blockbuster draft day trade to get Eli Manning for the Giants), his tepid relationship with coach Tom Coughlin, etc. I'm a big Redskins fan and was re-traumatized reading about Tiki Barber's last game when he ran roughshod over us. But for the most part it was just sort of boring. Not really in-depth about anything technical (e.g., salary cap management), and too many predictable stories (that Joe Paterno was really something; watching Willie Mays play baseball was exciting) and opinions (injuries hurt the team's chances in playoffs......).Might have worked well as an audio book. The style fits the format of someone's telling you anecdotes that you can sample a few minutes at a time in the car or walking to the train or something.",
            "With a number of meanders, and the only story line, the 2006 football season of the New York Giants, seemingly an afterthought, this book never really seems to be about anything. Rather it's just a bunch of recorded reminiscing by a retiring General Manager of the New York Giants, which would all be well and good, but there's no back story given to a number of the names and events that come up in the process. An 'inside story' it is not, which left me wandering 'so what?' If you're a Giants fan, you might like it, but if you're not and you're going to only read one football book in the near future, read  The Blind Side, for sure.",
            "The GM is fairly interesting if you're a Giants/Colts fan and somewhat interesting from a football fan view point in general.I don't think it gave particularly great insight into what it is like to be a GM in the NFL, nor any great insight into Ernie Accorsi himself (past the fact that he loves QBs and hates the Eagles).The prose is a bit rambling, often confusing the reader as to who is expressing a particular thought as the author jumps into first person narrative with whomever he's addressing (including himself).It was an enjoyable book (I'm a Giants fan) but didn't give me the depth I was looking for. Still worth the read though.",
            "The GM is Moneyball for Football. Not in the sense that it looks at statistical analysis being applied to sport, but in the way it chronicles the thoughts and methods of a General Manager as he builds his team. A very well-written look at everything that goes on behind the scenes at a professional sports franchise, although given that the author and his subject (former Giants GM Ernie Accorsi) were close friends, at times it felt like the shining portrait of Accorsi and his talents might be a bit overstated. Overall an interesting read, probably a great read for Giants fans (who suck)."

But it has only been since the war in Vietnam and Laos, which displaced many Hmong, that the new, narrative form of 'story cloths' has emerged, a bridge between past and present.Dia Cha and her family experienced this displacement. Born in Laos, Dia fled with her family to Thailand as a child, spending four years in a refugee camp before arriving in the U.S. Her story is shared by many Hmong Americans.As told through the story cloth stitched by her aunt and uncle, the Hmong people's search for freedom began long ago in China. Dia's Story Cloth explores many aspects of the Hmong experience from peace and war in Asia to new beginnings in America. Through Dia's story, young children can see that the search for freedom transcends all cultures.This book includes a compendium of Hmong culture: their history, traditions, and stitchery techniques.",

The Hmong people have a tradition of needlework, and it wasn\u2019t until the displacement of Hmong people from war that the narrative form of story cloth emerged. The story doesn\u2019t just include her family\u2019s search for freedom in America, but also the history of Hmong people\u2019s search for freedom from China long ago. Through Dia\u2019s story, the readers can learn about Hmong culture, tradition, and stitchery techniques. The readers can also see that the search for freedom is always common no matter what culture. This book is suitable for ages 7-9 and the themes include wartime experience, immigration, refugees, and memories.",
            "Dia Cha shares her family's story cloth in this book. The story cloth tells the tell of the Hmong people and their travel from China to Laos looking for freedom to practice their beliefs and continue their culture. Dia Cha shows the entire cloth and then explains it in small snapshots. It is a beautifully told story and I love how she explains small portions of the cloth, but also shows the complexity of it as a whole. I would definitely be interested in hearing more about Dia Cha and her life in the United States and her work with Hmong refugees.I would have given this book 5 stars except the information about Hmong American dress at the end was so terribly boring. Written just like a textbook. Such a shame that part was handled so poorly. ",
            "Absolutely lovely book, with a lot of great contextual information in the back.",
            "This is the story of Dia and her family as they were forced to leave their home in Laos. She describes the war that tore her people apart, and how she and her family had escaped to avoid communist soldiers. In addition to her own experience, this book describes the life of the Hmong people and their fight for freedom over the years. We see the challenges they faced as men were sent to war, they experienced bombings that destroyed villages and the overall fear that people had. They had to embark on a dangerous journey across harsh terrains in order to be free, and how people ended up in refugee camps. Many people are not aware of the history of the Hmong people. Dia Cha provides insight into the difficult lives that Hmong people had, and how hard they fought to be free. The story is told through embroidered story cloths that show Dia and her family\u2019s experience. These vivid and detailed story cloths are a huge part of Hmong culture, making it an important element to include in this story. ",
            "Beautiful, gentle introduction to the Hmong people and their history. The story is similar to other refugee stories, but the illustrations (all come from a Hmong story cloth) are breathtaking and add authenticity and emotion to the author's voice. Recommended!",

            "This is the first book in a long running series called Deathlands. The series is written by several authors writing under the pen name James Axler. This is the one that started it all, and I've waited a long time to be able to read it. I enjoy a good literary art piece as much as the next book nerd, but sometimes the old gray matter needs a break...well here it is. I've been looking for a good action Mad Max esque post-apocalyptic book for quite some time. A literary masterpiece this most certainly isn't. It is exactly as one would expect it to be. Life as we know it was obliterated in a nuclear apocalypse in 2001. Pilgrimage is several generations after the nuke. Ryan Cowdar and Krysty Wroth are the main protagonists with an array of supporting characters. Ryan is a mysterious bad ass with an eye patch, Krysty is a tall big boobed combat trained red headed beauty. Together with their team of warrior merchants they take on the ruthless baron of a Plague Pit town. There is lots of bloody action",
            "Deathlands 1: Pilgrimage to Hell / 0373625014I'm a fan of the Deathlands series, although I can't quite put my finger on why. They're pretty much gun-'n'-torture fantasies that take place in an apocalyptic America where might makes right and men are real men and women are real women and death is always lying just around the corner. Not the sort of thing I usually eat up, but the setup is so fascinating that I can't quite look away -- each book is a very careful variation on the same themes and it's delightful to see what the bevy of authors who write these books will come up with next. (I've heard them described as popcorn -- no nutritional value whatsoever, but you can't stop eating! Er, reading!)I recently decided to re-read my Deathlands novels, so I've been going through in order. Pilgrimage to Hell is the first book in the series",
            "This has been recommended to me several times, but I didn't think it was my cup of tea. I happened to stumble on this abridged audio version at my library, so I thought I'd give it a try.I think I read this or one of the books years ago, but I'm not sure. I get it confused with Jerry Ahern's Survivalist series (Total War) & possibly some others from the 70s. These are guy action porn that seemed to litter the landscape, so were handy to read when nothing else was at hand. I never cared for them much, though. Like the Executioner series (Mac Bolan) they rely on a strong, driven protagonist who kills all the bad guys with lots of different weapons. One of the most irritating habits of the writing is to describe just the gun in great detail (.45 caliber Heckler & Koch HK45 with a blah blah blah & a this that & the other thing plus a so & so scope with x, y, & z) almost every time it is mentioned & then use the damn thing like a club. They also seem to have an endless supply of good-guy bullets plus plenty of other lethal devices until they should walk bowlegged.Anyway, this book was pretty good as an abridged audio. I got the gist of the story without being too turned off. The plot was fairly stupid & showed up more since it wasn't hidden by the detail, but it was kind of fun & had some interesting points. For instance, the women are strong & well done. There were a lot of cool toys, nasty bad guys, & heroic good guys/girls. Some even died. While traditional races were equal, all muties were bad... well, almost. There is a slightly interesting twist there that will be exploited in later books I assume. It was also pretty gritty, which I like.I can't recommend this series. I prefer the Destroyer series which made fun of the Executioner, James Bond, Doc Savage, & other such books plus the politics of the day. The Horse Clan series is set in a post apocalyptic world created by nuclear war like this series & far more interesting to me.",
            "One of the reasons I rate this book so highly is because I was expecting so little from it, and it is very rare that I have been so completely surprised. On one level, it contained all of the elements I would expect from a post-nuclear-holocost-survivalist-novel, lots of focus on gun models (which mean nothing to me), scaly flesh-eating mutants, slowly awakening psionic powers in the more acceptable mutants",
            "This was my first audio book with sound affects to accompany the narrative, and I wasn't sure what to make of it at first. The violent PA setting is ideal for this sort of treatment, with gunshots, explosions, shouting, screaming and the rest. However, I was pleased to be on the motorway and out of earshot when I hit a sex scene... The Graphic Audio treatment means that Pilgrimage to Hell comes across as more of a play than a narration",
            "Even for 1986 this is not a good book. It\u2019s got a whole lot of crazy ideas about the world 100 years after a nuclear war that would eventually make their way into video games (and still used to this day), from monstrous mutations to living fog, but the execution is just severely lacking. Even back then I would\u2019ve thought it was silly and sexist, and I\u2019m the exact target audience for this stuff. I mean, I was into books like Systemic Shock by Dean Ing and movies like Escape from New York. It\u2019s not offensive or anything, just really clunky. I got this on Hoopla as an audiobook with a full cast recording and sound effects, made by GraphicAudio, and I have no issues with the production. They did the best they could given the material. It\u2019s the underlying story that doesn\u2019t work for me.",
            "In 2001 the bombs went off and destroyed the world as we know it. What was once America is now the Deathlands, a hellish landscape populated by mutated humans and beasts, pockets of surviving humans trying to cling to life, and roving marauders looking to take advantage of the weak. Now a small group of warriors have banded together to seek the secrets of prewar science experiments that could be the key to their survival in the Deathlands. ",
            "My ratings system is as follows. One star is GOOD. The book is entertaining, easy to read and you don't want to stop reading because something about the book is compelling you not to. Two stars is GREAT! This time the story is not only entertaining, but highly creative, unique, easy to read and hard to put down. Three stars is EXCELLENT. Here the book has all aspects of one and two stars, but now the book is thought and emotionally provoking. Four is AWESOME. This is the read that is not only creative, original and emotionally and utterly captivating, but you are overwhelmed at how talented and skilled the author is in telling you their story. Literary brilliance. Five is PHENOMENAL. This is the book that has all the components of the previous four ratings but leaves that lasting impression. It's the book that changes dramatically your point of view and your interpretation of experiences you or others around you endure.",

It's the first of a long series of novels set in a post apocalyptic America and started in the 1980s. That sentence probably tells you a lot of what you need to know and the book delivers the extreme violence and despair you'd expect, but there's an inventiveness and playfulness to the storytelling that lifts it enough to make it a fun and satisfying read.

            "My brother Scott bought a few Deathlands novels that I remember while growing up. By the time I was a teenager only one, Ice and Fire was still around. I read it and liked it",
            "My dad is a fan of this classic 80s pulp science fiction series about life after worldwide nuclear apocalypse (think if Matthew Broderick did not succeed in preventing global thermonuclear war at the end of War Games) and he gave me the first two books to read. It's a lot of fun if you go into with the right expectations, and by that I mean, no expectations of quality writing but lots of gore and explosions and weaponry and devastated landscapes and mutated creatures and a series of hard-bitten testosterone-fueled men who are either outright villains or antiheroes just trying to survive. They could all be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch and Sly Stallone as Rambo. Oh, and one hot outrageously sexualized chick who can hold her own with the menfolk but still, of course, is repeatedly threatened with sexual violence throughout the course of the book. I won't even get started on the role of women in this story.OK, let's be honest: these are not good novels. Even in the 80s, they were not good novels. Still, there was something nostalgic about reading this for me, because it reminded me of all the time I spent in the 80s and early 90s reading RPG-related novels and all the other serialized novels, like the Thieves World stories and another shared-world series (that I can't remember the title of) that involved magical races returning in this technology-heavy future, so there were elves who could hack computers with chips in their brains and so on. (If any of you reading this know what I'm talking about, tell me!) And there are some really cool, creative details to the world-building and mutations that no amount of bad, melodramatic purple prose can mask, and despite myself there were a couple of times where I really wanted to know what was going to happen, especially since it ended in exactly the right place. I would never seek out and read the 100+ novels in this series (many hard to find these days), but I'll skim through the start of the second just to see what happens to Ryan and Krysty (yes, I know, I know). ",
            "Overall, a mediocre plus read. Slow starting to me. Opening scene and characters felt cliched, probably because it's been so many years since the book was written. Unfortunately, I knew what was going to happen the whole time, it was just a matter of getting there. The bit of mystery that stayed unresolved and kept being hinted at, was the only thing that kept me interested. I was surprised by the ending though. It made the possibilities for the continued story seem more worthy of my time to find out about. I will probably read the next one to see how the series evolves. I like a good series, and there are tons of books in this one, so I'm not ready to write it off just yet.",
            "This was a pretty good story. I would give it 3.5-4 stars. The narration was really good. One thing I didn't like was some of the voice acting sound fake and cartoonish.This is the first story in the deathlands series originally published in the 80s and still being written until the end of 2015. The story is about the survivors after a nuclear war that wipes out civilization. I don't think these books are still available in book format however they have been transferred to an audiobook format that includes voice actors, sound effects and background music. The target audience is now long haul truck drivers. ",
            "This was my first Audio Book from Graphic Audio. Honestly, I was very distracted by the ... well ... graphics. Blood and guts and squishy sounds and every time they mentioned a weapon they had to mention the ENTIRE weapon's name. Which got a little grating. Otherwise I liked it. Though I did find that it lost my attention every now and then. ",
            "Glad I listened to it instead of reading it. Purple prose to the point of unintentional humor. Enjoyable post apocalyptic storyline but I don't think I could have forced my way thru this one. I have more on audio and will continue to listen on the train. Hopefully they get better.",

            "Anyone who has ever played one of the popular Fallout games will recognise the world presented in Deathlands: Pilgrimage to Hell (written by Christopher Lowder and Laurence James under the name Jack Adrian). I\u2019d go as far as to say they\u2019d feel quite at home there.\tA hundred years after a global nuclear war the world has settled into a place without borders, where land is separated into places you can live and places where the acid rains would sear your flesh from your bones.\tIn the continent that was once called North America no trace of government remains. There are no cities to speak of and what infrastructure remains is maintained by a series of feudal lords that called themselves \u201cBarons\u201d. These violent and disturbed men carve up the land between them and lord over them with iron fists, guarding their land jealously.\tAcross this land travels The Trader, a Baron in his own right, but a baron of a mobile city that moved from village to village trading goods and skills with the survivors.\tThe Trader is no hero, this was no longer a land for heroes, but he was a man with a code, and all those who worked with him shared his code. One such man was Ryan, a battered man running from some undisclosed pursuer, who served as The Traders lead war council.\tAfter many years trading and travelling across the desolate wasteland Ryan happens upon a young flame-haired woman who insists on there being a hidden land of plenty hidden in the Badlands. Ryan had heard these tales before, but later \u2013 when he hears a very similar story from an aged actor \u2013 he becomes intrigued and begins looking deeper.\tDeathlands: Pilgrimage to Hell could easily be dismissed as just another Mad Max clone, and this would not be entirely unfair, but there is more to the book. It is undoubtedly a direct response to the movie Mad Max 2 (known as The Road Warrior in the US), but as the story unfolds and we finally find the \u201cpromised land\u201d in the shape of The Redoubt.\tHere we discover something that Hollywood would later repurpose into the main plot element of the film Stargate (some ten years later) as well as containing underground complexes that gamers would recognise from Fallout (which was some six years later).\tThere\u2019s not a lot of plot to Pilgrimage to Hell, but then there rarely is to stories set in a post-apocalyptic world. These tend to be stories of survival and conflict set against extreme violence and deprivation.\tBut it\u2019s best not to confuse plot and story with such novels. The plots may all follow a very similar pattern but the stories, they can be as diverse as any novel. \tCan be, not that they are always of course.\tWith the addition of The Redoubt, a system of instant teleportation across the continental US, the topography of the Deathlands becomes a whole new interesting place. It promises stories set across extremely diverse cultures derived from hundreds of years of evolution from the cultures of today.\tAs a \u201cset up\u201d for future books (of which there are many, but more on that a little later) Pilgrimage to Hell works extremely well, but does it as a stand-alone novel?\tThis is a difficult thing to ascertain. This kind of book is rather niche. Its unapologetically \u201cmasculine\u201d in its approach, burly men carrying a dizzying array of firearms \u2013 many of them meticulously described \u2013 while dispatching foes in undeniably gruesome ways, but it also has some moments of human interaction that come as a bit of a surprise.\tWhen Ryan meets the flame haired woman \u2013 who we learn is called Krysty (that\u2019s not a typo) \u2013 a romance blossoms, and the reader not only has to steel themselves to some steamy scenes but some surprising tenderness from our anti-hero.\tThis all comes after a few hundred pages of ultra-violence, tolchokery and devotchka chasing, so don\u2019t expect the tenderness to come without a price. \t(And if those words meant nothing to you, well\u2026)\tIf you like the Mad Max movies, or you eagerly await the next Fallout then you should probably seek out a copy of Deathlands: Pilgrimage to Hell. They\u2019re available easily enough online, but none of the books ever got a release in the UK. I particularly enjoyed the audio release, presented by a company called Graphic Audio. It was a full cast dramatization that stuck very closely to the written word, making it a full nine-hour long audio play.\tI have the next three books on my shelf to read, but \u2013 to be perfectly honest \u2013 I\u2019ll probably forego reading them if I can find the Graphic Audio presentations instead.\tDeathlands is a long running series that consists of a staggering 125 books (and a further sixteen audio-only episodes), and a spin-off series called The Outlanders.\tI don\u2019t know how far I\u2019m going to get through these 125 books, but as I\u2019m already halfway through the second book (Deathlands: Red Holocaust) I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a fair few of them on my shelf by the end of the year.\tBe warned though, Deathlands books are pretty extreme in their depictions of violence so if you\u2019re a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d kind of person just assumed they have every trigger warning you can think of printed in fluorescent red on their covers.",
            "Packed full of violence, sex, explosions, bloodshed, mutants, cliched antagonists and protagonists, car chases, warlords, desperation, destruction, cheesy dialogue, nuclear wastelands, and just about every other known trope in the post apocalyptic genre, Pilgrimage to Hell may be the perfect example of just how right all those things can actually be.I loved pretty much every moment of this novel. It\u2019s action packed and surprisingly well written for a cheap, pulp-esque testosterone fueled and testosterone minded audience. There\u2019s nothing even remotely deep or mind changing, but it\u2019s a ton of fun to read. Such a pitty that James Axler (Jack Adrian) never got to experience a true level of recognition he rightfully deserved.My one complaint? The last 20% of the book dragged a bit. Nothing wrong with it, just felt a little slow in comparison with the first 80%. Still though, I don\u2019t know where this series has been my whole life. Just glad I found the Deathlands and something new to sink my teeth into. ",
            "Violent Action Movie for your Mind\u2122These graphic audio books are a bit of a guilty pleasure. They are totally pulp (marketed toward long haul truckers with actual commercials [for their own product] at the end of some of the discs). But they are well produced with decent actors, great SFX, music, etc. The story is pretty straight forward. I think of it as Fallout The Book. This one started with how the world ended, which is pretty terrifying. But the book itself just takes place about 100 years later after things have kind of settled and is full of outlaws and whatnot. Far future wild west, maybe. The book is very violent and sometimes pretty graphically so. There is a couple graphic sex scenes as well.The action is exciting and fast paced. The characters are fairly flat but interesting. The monsters are pretty horrific. The pacing overall is good, with decent lulls in the action without getting long. Just fun books. "

When an adult will be reading the ostensibly rhyming book to the child, the author should at least attempt a rhyme scheme, meter, and a little sense. Both my husband and I agreed that we'd never read it to our kids again, based solely on how awful it was for us to read out loud.Actual text from the book:Down goes the yellow sun.Blue Train Thomas' day is done.Home now to the Shed.'Peep",
            "Thomas works all day while Percy works all night. It's a nice concept with some idea repetition but the rhymes don't quite fit and the rhythm is a little awkward at times. Not one of my favorites for reading out loud.",

            "This is a fine book for any little Thomas fan, but as a book for teaching colors it's not the best. I think the illustrations were good enough to give a good idea of white, yellow, and blue. But the orange and red illustrations were barely distinguishable. My son also had troubles recognizing that Percy driving at night was green, I think because the darker shade they're using (for night time scenery) is too close to blue for a beginner. The pictures of Percy in the daylight he was able to identify green, so I'll give them half credit for that color ;-).Overall, there are better books for color recognition out there.",
            "This is a great book for the little ones. It has rhythmic writing which I like when I am reading to my son so he can listen to my voice and get used to me reading to him. I hope that it will inspire a later love of reading that I have if I continuously read to him. This book is about Thomas and Percy and their day and night shifts transferring various goods around during the day and night respectively. The goods are described by their colours that I can use to teach my son.",

The book described all kinds of goods loaded on them. For young children, this book can be used to teach them label colors; for older children this book can be used to inform them the utility of a train in the city. ",

All four books are of typical Thomas fashion using vivid colors, inclusion of many Thomas's friends, and age appropriate storylines that my son highly enjoys. Any book that Parker picks up and hands me to read him gets a thumbs up from me, these books get read much more than others!"

            "This is a packed little book, containing references to serving as a prequel to Trial of a Time Lord, all the original Great Intelligence stories, The Invasion, and (I'm told by the internet) a HP Lovecraft crossover to boot. As a result, it's not a very complete read on its own, and probably would be more enjoyable with previous background of those stories plus other books contained in this publishing line...That said, the story containned does stand on it's own: as with the author's previous DW attempt (Crystal Bucephalus) the original cast of the day is very compelling and layered (both Barry and Louise are afforted nice little backgrounds that don't take up too much time but make them reachable and sympathic). The science-fiction elements(particularly the whole programming of The Codex in the first part) are all really interesting. The urban fantasy elements in the second part also have a nice 80/90-ness to it that makes them feel retro (instead of just dating the book).There's a huge jump in the second half of the book",
            "This book has big, colorful ideas, inspired by comic books and the weirder kinds of sci-fi. And on the one hand, the writing can't quite live up to them - the characters are stiff and the style is lacking. But on the other hand - first, there are sudden, surprising moments of powerful emotional honesty that appear out of nowhere and end just as quickly; and second, the writing is good enough to get across some of the sheer coolness of the ideas. It's not a great book, but it can be a good one.",
            "This may be Craig Hinton's best novel. It is more controlled than the others I have read. There are still problems with it that are common to his Doctor Who books, but these do not quite get in the way as much as they do in the others. The story is that Doctor 6 and Mel are in London for the Millennium change. Mel is meeting up with old college friends, while the Doctor looks up his old friend Anne Travers, now Dame Anne Travers, a powerful civil servant who was the person most responsible for funding UNIT. However, nefarious deeds are afoot involving Ashley Chapel from Gary Russell's novel System Shock, who once worked closely with Tobias Vaughn and has taken his mentor's idea of giving order to the world in a different direction. This first part of the novel, more than half, is mostly a techno-thriller. Chapel's plans go wrong, though, and he creates instead a pocket dimension out of a large part of London which is its own world ruled by magic, and all the major characters in the first part reappear here in different form in the second part. This second section is a mixed magic-tech / swords and sorcery story. What ties these all together is an attempt from Hinton to pull in Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Generally, the novel is interesting enough. Hinton still indulges in many of the things I have found annoying in his other novels. One is the gods of the universe, super-powerful beings from dark times. These are almost impossible to write well because they end up becoming too mundane and human. Another is to throw in too many winks and nods to previous Doctor Who to make a poor little ultrafan's heart go pitter-patter. We also get clumsy emotional scenes in the midst of violent chaos",
            "Colin Baker is so terribly underrated as the doctor but I think he\u2019s actually one of the best actors to take on the role. I\u2019ve wanted to experience more of the sixth doctor books so I decided to read this one which is written by Craig Hinton who sadly is no longer with us. The book itself is split into two main parts which act like episodes, with chapters in between. It does have a third part however this only consists of a small number of pages. The first part was absolutely fantastic with some truly engaging scenes and great chapter endings that made me wanting to read more. The second part however dipped a little in quality. The first part of the book introduces the reader to the characters and here we have some characters that were well written and made me care about them. The Doctor and Mel arrive on Earth, London 1999 near the time of the Millenial and they realise that something evil is going on inside Canary Warf. After an epic build up and a brilliant cliffhanger, the second part feels somewhat convoluted and a little rushed. The characters get teleported into another dimension and from then on the book starts to go down hill. Even though the latter half was still enjoyable to an extent, there were certain parts that did feel completely rushed. However there were some nice twists and turns along the way.Overall Millenial Rites is a decent read. As previously mentioned, the first half was amazing with the latter half being not so great. If you\u2019re a fan of the Sixth Doctor and Mel I would say that you might enjoy this one. I do wish the Great Intelligence was used a little bit more but I guess the writer had to save room for another major returning villain. ",
            "Millennial Rites is the last Doctor Who Missing Adventures book that I have in paperback, though I have a few more to read as e-books. It was published by Virgin Publishing, and it's an original novel featuring the Sixth Doctor as played by Colin Baker and Mel (Melanie Bush) as played by Bonnie Langford. The story is told in three distinct parts.In part one, the Doctor is unusually pre-occupied with his own future, having just gone through his Trial at the hands of the Time Lords and the Valeyard. He and Mel land in London on New Year's Eve 1999. There they run into Anne Travers who after the events of the Doctor Who Missing Adventures novel, Downtime, has become even more determined to defeat the Great Intelligence. Mel attends her 10-year college reunion, only to have someone slip her a request to hack a computer company that's closing it's doors on New Year's Eve, making the staff redundant (in other words, they are all fired except a small research group). Two of the fired employees: Barry and Louise get involved in the situation (as does Louise's very young daughter, Cassie).Barry shows Louise a CD of computer code he lifted from the office - but when he does so, her computer becomes alive, then a monster attacks them. The three escape, Louise leaves her daughter with her mother, then they attempt to find the other fired employee that Barry stole the computer disk from. But another of the Cybrid monsters has already killed him.In the fracas, Barry and Louise meet up with the Doctor and Mel. The Doctor fears Ashley Chapel of the computer firm is trying to bring back Verocyl - but he's wrong. The Doctor tries to prevent Anne Travers from casting her banishment spell - and fails. Everyone rushes to Ashley's computer company to stop him running the Millennium Codex - and again, the Doctor fails.In Part Two, everyone suddenly wakes in a fantasy world ruled by three continuously fighting monarchs: The Technomancer, Majestrix Melaphyre (Mel), ruler of the Ziggurat of Sciosophy; The Archimage, Magnus Ashmael (Ashley Chapel), ruler of the Tower of Abraxis; and the Hierophant, Bibliotrix Anastasia (Anne Travers), ruler of the Labyrinth of Thaumaturgy. Mel is attended by fantasy versions of Barry and Louise, who have a daughter, Cassandra, in the fantasy world as well.The Doctor appears to be unchanged at first, and quickly escapes the Archimage. However, in the fantasy world he is slowly being changed into the Valeyard. However, it is the Doctor who establishes an alliance between Melaphyre and Anastasia - who must prevent Magnus Ashmael from further destroying not simply the new and unstable fantasy universe, but the real universe. This time he succeeds.The final part wraps up the story. As life in London in the New Millennium is returned to normal.Millennial Rites is two stories in one - part one is a Cyberpunk nightmare as a computer guru attempts to take over the world with malicious code. Part two is an intriguing fantasy. I enjoyed both parts - and I liked the idea that the Doctor",
            "Craig Hinton can be a divisive author amongst us who fans. Some find the continuity heavy plots hard work. I never really minded that. Yes, some of the references are throwaway and are there just purely for fellow fans to spot but that is fine by me. Another entry in the virgin missing adventures books. Featuring the sixth doctor and mel bush it sees the return of the great intelligence and anne travers, from the Patrick troughton era and explores the character of the valeyard. I found this a little hard going at the time of publication but I was unwell at the time so was struggling to concentrate on reading. It's a complex plot and on reflection over the interviewing years it was a decent story. The characters were good with the established characters being well drawn. It's a book I've been meaning to read again for years. Three stars might be a bit mean as I was unwell and that definitely affected my enjoyment of this one."

However, some elements of the novel are decidedly anacronistic; the behaviour and manner in which the characters address each other would have been extremely shocking in Regency England, to say the least. For example, there is absolutely no way Meredith and Alexander would have addressed each other by first name, nor would she have shortened it to Alex",

Although the approach is light on grammar--sometimes too much so!--French has enough similarities to my native English that this wasn't too much of an issue and I was able to supplement my reading with Harper's Short Grammar of French. Where Sandberg excels is through his use of exercises--very many exercises--to cement the concepts provided in the previous section",
            "This is the standard text for learning written, academic French, similar in most ways to Jannach's German for Reading Knowledge. Sandberg gets rave reviews, so maybe my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed. The biggest flaws were the use of odd terms for tenses and voices (neither the French names nor their most common English translations), the lack of proofreading (there are pages on which answers are keyed to the wrong questions, or French phrases don't line up with English equivalents, and the fact that extremely common and extremely rare constructions were treated in roughly equivalent depth. Also, while I do understand that using out-of-copyright materials probably reduces the cost, there's really no excuse for including passages about hostile natives or benevolent Anglo-Saxon experts in a modern textbook.

            "For class",

            "This is an amazing book. Grammar lessons are clear and the exercises are comprehensive but not redundant. My favorite thing about this book is that Sandberg primes you for upcoming grammar lessons; he'll include an unfamiliar grammatical structure in one of the texts or exercises, which will be confusing at the time but which he'll explain a few sections later. Really great.",

Although I've studied French before, I needed a refresher before taking a translation exam that is required for my degree. This text covers all of the relevant verb tenses and helpful grammar constructions found in academic texts. It also reinforces useful vocabulary. Organized in short subjections, there are review quizzes at the end of each chapter complete with answers, so you can know if you are getting it or not (and it refers you back to the section if you need to further review).

The book uses a unique system that inductively teaches vocab and grammar: the student uses a bookmark and scans down the page; French sentences are given on the right side; English answers are given a little further down on the left. Donc, on peut se corriger sans un professeur! This book was good preparation for my own graduate program in biblical studies, and it also was a helpful resource during my time in France. Si on veut apprendre un peu de fran\u00e7ais, bonne chance et bon courage! ",

The lessons are a must learn for those, like myself, trudging through graduate school who need to be able to read proficiently in a foreign language. This one's a keeper on my reference shelf.",
            "The best approach to gaining a reading language that I've encountered yet. If you are willing to put in five months of consistent work (2-3 sessions/wk), you should be able to gain a reading knowledge of French with nothing more than this book, a dictionary, and a few other French texts of the sort you'd like to be reading.

            "Absolutely the best book for anyone who wants to learn to read technical books in French. I used this to prepare for my graduate language test when working on my Ph.D. When I was done, I could read mathematics texts in French and translate them easily on the fly. I've studied several other languages using other methods and never managed to achieve much fluency in them. ",

        "description": "It is the eve of City Tastes, Washington, D.C.'s gourmet gala featuring the delectable handiwork of the city's culinary stars. Renowned restaurant reviewer Chas Wheatley expects to fill her biting 'Washington Examiner' column with reports of a sassy 'soupe en chamise' or a poor 'palourde en beignets'. But when chef Lawrence Levain's heart suddenly stops the night before the event, everyone is quick to name his soaring cholesterol as the culprit. Except Chas, whose discriminating senses smell murder. Armed with her saber-sharp pen and critic's eye for things amiss, Chas circuits the restaurant scene, doling out biting reviews and delicious recipes, while probing into Lawrence's untimely demise. With a dollop of help from her loved ones at home and a 'soupcon' of advice form a secret admirer at work, Chas's tastebuds lead her down a dangerous trail of revenge and murder, where her next bite could be her last.",

            "What a fun book in this first of a three-book series.",
            "This was a highly entertaining book about a restaurant reviewer trying to figure out the murder of a past lover who was a notable Chef. We are introduced to Chas Wheatley, working for the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Examiner. Chas is a divorced woman with one child who is an adult. Chas is in charge of her life, she is still friends with her ex-husband, Ari, a famous chef himself. Chas is also in a relationship that is at that difficult stage of either committing or moving on. Chas' daughter, Lily lives in Philadelphia in the music world. Chas is not ready for her former lover and friend, Laurence to be murdered.Chas uses her lover, an investigative reporter to meet a homicide detective and get him working on the case. The detective is leaning towards believing Laurence's death to be natural causes, until Chas receives a death threat.The book is fast-paced, humorous, sexy, and clever. The murder is a mystery. I figured out the culprit but enjoyed watching Chas figure it out. I look forward to the next book in the series. This book is older but still up to date.",
            "Suppose one of the nation's best known, most trusted and widely read restaurant critics turned her writing talents to crafting a culinary mystery? Phyllis C. Richman was the food critic of the Washington Post for nearly thirty years. Known for her sometimes extravagant disguises, intended to prevent restaurateurs from recognizing her, she avoided being photographed to preserve her anonymity. Drawing on her insider's knowledge of restaurants, she wrote The Butter Did It: A Gastronomic Tale of Love and Murder in 1998. It introduces Chas Wheatley, coincidentally the restaurant critic for the fictitious Washington Examiner, who involuntarily becomes an amateur sleuth. Met with critical success (and an Agatha Award nomination), Richman churned Butter into a series with Murder on the Gravy Train in 1999 and Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham? in 2001. This is nobody's idea of great literature but it is pleasant reading for the culinarily inclined.",
            "The Butter Did It by Phyllis Richman is the first Chas Wheatley Mystery book. Chas Wheatley is a food critic and restaurant reviewer for the Washington Examiner. When her friend chef Laurence Levain dies, it is initially thought he has suffered a heart attack and Chas is instrumental in pointing the police correctly to murder, and she is herself then targeted by the murderer. I enjoyed this book very much, especially all the food descriptions. The murderer was a bit obvious and Chas seemed a bit slow in her sleuthing- even when being attacked by the murderer, it didn't seem to register with her. There was a lot of time spent on the background and past which made parts of the book drag a little, but overall it was an entertaining read. ",
            "As a first novel, this book was okay. There was nothing that made this book stand out from others in this particular genre theme. It became a bit boring at times but not overly boring. I enjoyed the many food references made through out the book. The main plot/story line was good but the characters were not all that interesting. This book is what I classify as an in betweener",
            "Maybe I fell asleep while reading, but why a certain character lied is never addressed. Our main character is a bumbling sleuth who walks around at night in the city, even though someone may be trying to kill her. There were some good moments in the book but overall it was just readable. I was bothered by a loose end left unanswered; but since I live near D.C., I enjoyed reading familiar names of places I have been to or know about.",
            "Did not guess who the guilty party was until the end. Remembered author from when she was the food critic at the Washington Post, so thought I would give the book a try. A bit dated but have to remember when it was written. Enjoyable book.",
            "Audiobook - I'd give this book a 3.5. It was entertaining enough to listen to.",
            " Chas (aka Charlotte Sue) Wheatley is the restaurant critic for the Washington Examiner writing the obituary for Laurence Levain, a well-known Washington chef. What is not known is that Chas and Laurence are friends and had been lovers back in Paris in their younger days. Laurence is found dead from an apparent heart attack the night before a big food gala called City\u00acTastes. The death scene has been made to look as if he had been entertaining a woman before he died, but Chas has personal information about Laurence that makes her sure this is not true. Police detective Homer Jones, who loves to eat, Chas' daughter Lily, and various chefs all figure in the story of how Chas solves the mystery. Phyllis Richman is the restaurant critic for the Washington Post, which added to my enjoyment of the book."

Compiled from Ireland\u2019s abundant reserve of ghost stories, this richly varied collection of legendary and ancestral phantoms, uncanny forewarnings of death, and a host of other unearthly experiences relies on the memories of ordinary Irish folk scattered throughout the isle.The collection of entertaining tales was the offspring of a newspaper article in which authors St. John D.

Classified by geographical area, the simple yet compelling narratives \u2014 at once disarming, convincing, and illuminating \u2014 provide amazing descriptions of paranormal experiences. An entertaining, authentic glimpse of late 19th- and early-20th-century Ireland and the superstitious natures of its people, True Irish Ghost Stories is a delightful treasury of other-worldly happenings \u2014 to be shared by devotees of Irish lore, mystery lovers, and connoisseurs of the paranormal.",

            "The stories related in this collection were intriguing and spooky, for the most part, but unfortunately I did not care for the author\u2019s style of writing. It read more like a bunch of newspaper articles, instead of smoothly transitioning amongst stories and keeping the creepy atmosphere. ",
            "There are more things in heaven and in earth",
            "Interesting book but quite repetitive and vague at times. I enjoyed it nonetheless.",
            "As a certified paranormal researcher and investigator, I love reading material on this subject. This book, first published in 1916, repeats stories sent to the compilers by various reliable people. The first sections of the book are divided into areas of Ireland as well as categories of phenomenon. I was fascinated by the conclusions which really showed an understanding of possible growth and understanding in the field of parapsychology for the future. There is much we don't know and will probably never know but I can testify to how exciting it is to stand in a dark room with a tape recorder as the room looses all warmth asking questions only to find on review you received answers.",
            "It's not so much a collection of ghost stories as it is a list of sightings or experiences gathered via newspaper ad (as this was originally written in the beginning of the 20th century). Most of the stories are brief, paragraph length or so, but some are several pages. After the first few chapters, they all blend together and it was difficult to keep reading. But they do give insight on the superstitious beliefs of the time though, so they still have value. I just would not recommend reading it all the way through, but perhaps focusing on certain sections that are most interesting to you.",
            "Even though it was written in 1912 it still is written in spirit of modern language, very interesting to be able to understand worries and thoughts from people from a different century, with little to no difficulties",

I started out reading it with my daughter, but it was just a very dry reading overall, so I ended up just recording the rest for her to listen when she wants later. I don't know why I was expecting something much more lively, but I was. So it was a bit disappointing. However, that being said, the experiences themselves were interesting and it's obvious that the author put a lot of work into collecting and compiling the stories, which he did fairly well in the greater scheme of it all. I kind of wish Goodreads would allow half stars, because it's closer to a 2.5 for me, but it doesn't, so I'm going with 3.",
            "Even though I love ghost stories I was not satisfied with this book. I did like the fact that the author sought out people from all over Ireland to share their personal/familial ghost stories, however, the way the book itself was written made it extremely difficult to tell when you were going from one ghostly encounter to the next. I can appreciate that the author wanted to keep the exact words of the people who sent in these accounts...but honestly it was as much fun as reading a shopping list. Some of the content was interesting but overall I would not recommend this book to a friend. ",
            "This was a bit of a hard read. The book is a collection of ghost stories collected in Ireland, from various average people in the time frame (early 1900s). However, I feel stories is not an apt title for the volume at all",
            "The stories are from a period when people believed in the occult, s\u00e9ances were popular, people took pictures of themselves with their dead and decaying relatives who had recently died (photography being something very new) and other superstitious and silly things. It was particularly interesting to me from the perspective that my two Irish Grandmothers, who were devotedly Catholic believed in this sort of silly superstitious rubbish. It was literally a stroll into the past. ",
            "Oh. My. God. Writing is cringeworthy! The authors go from house to house to house and that's just the first chapter! At times I was confused and left scratching my head as I tried to figure out if we were on a new place or not. I should point out that I have the version copyrighted in 1974. I hope the newer copyrighted versions are better separated. ",
            "This collection of ghostly visitations was originally published in Dublin in 1926. It consists of tales solicited from the general public that tend, in the re-telling, to be curiously dry. I guess that the fiction medium works better than reportage when it comes to this type of material.",
            "Rather dry, as is the style of the time, but still some good stories",
            "Good on the whole. Interesting read.",
            "This is very good I'm not surprised the Irish are really good at ghost stories",
            "This looks like the precursor to Aaron Mahnke's Lore. It's interesting, but the stories are all clumped together in a way that makes it hard (and annoying) to read. ",
            "Blood curdling? No, not really. More like an atmospheric history lesson. Since the stories are short and between a 100 an 180 years old (some are even more antiquated and folklore only) they leave you with a series of snap shots of a past way of life, spiced up by the supernatural. So... If it's The Exorcist you're after move on to something else. But if you like your ghost stories low keyed and... don't get me wrong",
            "For some Halloween-y reading, I decided to read a book that I'd picked up over the summer in Maine: True Irish Ghost Stories, by St. John D. Seymour and Harry L. Neligan. It is now, as you can see, nearly December. This is because of NaNoWriMo. The most embarassing thing here is that True Irish Ghost Stories is barely a hundred pages long.A thing I did not realize at first is that this book is a reprint of a work that was originally published shortly after the turn of last century, when Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom. Once you start reading it, it's wildly obvious, because it's written in such an earnestly Edwardian manner. The book is a collection of short anecdotes, organized into categories, interspersed with a lot of arguments about why they are credible and that the fashionable skepticism about their validity is arrogance, arrogance I tell you. The two men who compiled this were obviously smart and well-educated men, who are actually quite vocal in their defense of the Irish populace from charges of superstition (a popular anti-Catholic stereotype)",
            "While reading this book the first page started to make me think twice about reading it because it seemed like it was going to be boring. However on page 5 it said On her return she asked the mother were the children all right",
            "This book was a rather quick read. Granted, I did skip over two chapters and a rather lengthy conclusion. I thought the book started out well enough, interesting, though nothing to brag about. I don't believe for a minute that any of the stories are true, but it still was interesting enough. By the end, however, I was getting bored and anxious to finish it and move onto my next book. It did teach me more about Irish folklore and ghost stories, but other than that it didn't really offer me anything too exciting. Maybe it's because most of the stories were written in the late 1800s and early 1900s so there was nothing too 'gruesome'. I thought it was really kind of boring all together. Interesting enough to hold my attention for a few hours, but not anything I'd run around screaming about how awesome it is, not that I was really expecting that. Still, I had hoped to enjoy this more than I did. However, it did have good premise and writing so perhaps some people may like it a lot more than I did. I encourage you to read this if you like paranormal things, ghost stories, and anthologies. If not, don't bother. ",
            "An interesting and spooky collection of stories that reminds me a lot of Lady Gregory's collection of Irish folktales and ghost stories. Although a few of the chapters were slow (particularly ones in which all the stories were similar, and thus blurred together, which happened a lot in the first three chapters), most of the stories in this book were riveting. And they miiight just give me a few nightmares. Haha.The story of the father's spirit that went to the girls' boarding school to find his daughter just before he died was surprisingly touching and stood out to me above all the other stories in this collection. I also laughed at the story of the girl who was haunted by the ghost, in the form of a rat, of a guy she friendzoned (for lack of a better word"

            "As another reviewer has mentioned, this is very dry. In the couple of years leading up to the course which used this book, I'd read dozens of academic psychology books (plenty more technical re. neuroscience) and this was the dullest by a considerable margin.Also was not very happy with some of the approaches: had found I leaned more towards a person-centred approach with psychodynamic elements, and also one somewhat critical of state-mandated uses of psychology to create lots of tidy little uncomplaining, conforming worker bees (in book form the best critique along such lines looks to be The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold us Well-Being ). To take one example, sections such as 'encourage the client to see every problem as an opportunity' appear naive and unempathic when applied to some circumstances, may set people up to fail or be unrealistic, and can also encourage a client to be people-pleasing or presentation orientated rather than accessing how they really feel. Actual counselling should be dealing with a greater level of complexity than the average \u00a36.99 self-help book. There are some brief therapy types, with certain types of people, such approaches are useful for, but the book, like government promoted attitudes (in the UK at least) encourages overapplication of these.Most training programmes probably implicitly allow for differences in approach, but too many students on them, not having done much other research, and often not coming from an academic background, accept approaches like Egan's uncritically without considering whether they are always appropriate, and/or the socioeconomics behind them. One may be expected to use them in certain placements or jobs, but people should be encouraged to see that this approach is by far from the only one, and should be able to maintain an ability to think outside it.

            "Provides a great basis but is painfully repetitive. This entire book could have been effectively written in <100 pages...",
            "This book has a poor layout and dry writing. The ideas/theory is interesting, but the text itself leaves much to be desired.",
            "This is the second time I have been assigned this text as part of a university course, and for the second time I didn't love it. Its density makes it tedious to read. The approach is a good starting point but could be explained in fewer words to make it more user friendly. ",
            "This is a very important book for those who work in a helping profession, especially those who do not naturally have an empathic inclination, or those who struggle to truly listen to the patient, or client. The book also goes over what may happen during helping sessions on the end of the client, and how it can be ethically, and professionally responded too. A great read. ",
            "The 3-stage model for care is nice and fairly clear. The best thing about the book is the pattern throughout of counselled statement, counselor response and then discussion. This really helps make the book both more interesting and clearer."

            "This 1865 novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, who also wrote the lovely North and South, is a pleasant but rather leisurely and lengthy tale of the personalities that inhabit an English country town in about the 1830's. The novel centers around Molly Gibson, the quiet and somewhat passive, but deeply sensitive, daughter of a widowed country doctor. We meet Molly and her father when she's an innocent 12 year old girl, about to spend the day visiting the estate of the local gentry, Lord and Lady Cumnor, so excited she can hardly sleep the night before. This visit won't turn out the way young Molly expected. These childhood scenes set the stage and introduce us to many of the characters who will play significant roles later on in the story. When Molly is a teenager one of her father's medical students, who boards with the Gibsons, falls in love with her. Mr. Gibson intercepts the young man's letter confessing his love and promptly ships Molly off to visit another local family and sends the young man away. But doing that isn't enough to allay Mr. Gibson's concerns, so he turns around and promptly proposes marriage to an attractive local widow (who has a daughter Molly's age), thinking a new mum for Molly is the ticket. It might have been a good idea to get to know her better before proposing. Just sayin'.Molly's new stepmother will prove a trial in her life (and in Molly's father's life as well, for that matter, although he's better able to deal with the disappointment, mostly by immersing himself further in his medical practice). Molly's new stepsister is much easier to get along with, but she'll also\u2014eventually\u2014end up bringing some serious complications to Molly's life. The first two-thirds of this novel was mildly enjoyable but didn't really engage me; I set the book aside several times while I read other books, without feeling terribly anxious to get back to it. Molly is sweet and kind and innocent, but I was getting a little impatient and frustrated with her and the people in her life. I seriously thought that I was going to have to rate this book three stars, and all my literary GR friends would be disappointed with me and my lack of taste and discernment and probably unfriend me en masse. Luckily for me, I really loved the last part of this book, enough to pull the overall rating up to four stars. The characters gradually became very real to me, with their quirks and failings described frankly, but with affectionate humor. Especially Mrs. Gibson, who sets new standards for bird-wittedness and vain self-absorption.Lady Cumnor: I was only speaking of the folly of people dressing above their station. \u2014 and what must the foolish woman do but begin to justify her own dress",
            "[Review on second reading]I have no words for how much I love this book and how thoroughly impressed I was on this reread. It is an incredible, beautiful, poignant, subtle novel, and an absolute must-read.[Review on third reading]I have to say this is fast becoming one of my absolute favourite novels of all time. What a book.",
            " To begin with the old rigmarole of childhood. In a country there was a shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there was a house, and in that house there was a room, and in that room there was a bed, and in that bed there lay a little girl\u2026  Wives and Daughters  reads like a fairytale and we are immediately enchanted by its gentle charm. Stepmother, prince, villain, woods, a ball, castle, climbing roses, birds and beasts. It's all there. However, the stepmother is not evil - just annoying and shallow. The prince is but a squire, the villain merely ungentlemanly. The woods is a friendly lesson in botany, the ball disappointing, the castle entailed, its timber rotting. Roses get tossed into the fire,'It is Mr. Preston,' said she, in answer to Molly. 'I shall not dance with him; and here go his flowers\u2014'Into the very middle of the embers, which she immediately stirred down upon the beautiful shrivelling petals as if she wished to annihilate them as soon as possible. Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell spins this long leisurely tale with such attention to detail, characters, and dialogue that you feel transported to another time and place. And bittersweet it is. Death, blackmail, secret promises, undisclosed marriages, politics, scandal, the worry of money are ever present. Her 'wicked' characters are presented with enough sympathy that you enjoy them as much as the good ones. Take Hyacinth Gibson for example - she corresponds somewhat to Mrs. Bennet in  Pride and Prejudice. Austen totally denied all sympathy to tedious Mrs. Bennet, but Gaskell makes sure we see Hyacinth as a person - selfish and shallow - but not uninteresting, and not incapable of sincere kindness.And the good characters are flawed - sometimes you are not certain to which side they'll land. Or where you'll land, given the exasperating qualities some of them have. There is mystery too given to these people, hints dropped about things that are not revealed by the author.I am completely in love with  Wives and Daughters, so take my 5 stars you pretty little thing.",
            "Do you like fairy tales? Well Gaskell certainly did:To begin with the old rigmarole of childhood. In a country there was a shire",
            "Wives and Daughters is Elizabeth Gaskell's final novel which was interrupted in its completion due to the untimely death of the author. However incomplete it may be to the end, I found the book to be a completed work with beautiful writing, an interesting set of characters, and a good storyline. At a time when the sensational novels were at the peak of their popularity",
            "MY HEART HURTSWHY DID THIS BOOK HAVE TO END",
            "Why has it taken me so long to finally read this wonderful novel? I bought the Penguin edition when I was in my 20s, read a page or two, put it down and didn't pick it up again. The book sat on my shelf for years. For all I know, it could be there still. However, after university I went right off Victorian literature and it's only been in the last twelve months or so that I've felt the desire to tackle it again. And now I've fallen in love with Elizabeth Gaskell's writing. In brief, the novel is set in the English Midlands in the 1830s and focuses on Molly Gibson, who lives in a small town with her widowed father, the local medical practitioner. Concerned to acquire an appropriate chaperone and guide for his teenage daughter, Mr Gibson re-marries the vain, self-absorbed and manipulative Hyacinth Kirkpatrick, who has a teenage daughter of her own, Cynthia. The story of Molly and Cynthia is a tale of love, friendship, secrets and scandal. Central to the narrative are the changes in English society, where class distinctions are slowly becoming blurred. The best thing about this novel are its characters. There is kind, loving Molly, her sarcastic and undemonstrative but deeply caring father, her truly awful stepmother and the fascinating",
            "2020 reread:My Jane Austen book group is reading this book, a great excuse for a reread, as it is one of my favorites of all time. I also remain firm in my belief that it is one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century. George Elliott certainly thought so--she admitted that this book was the inspiration for her great novel Middlemarch.I do think that this book is in conversation with Jane Austen on a number of levels, first being that what women thought matters. All kinds of women, whatever their rank, age, or economic status.On this reread, I noticed how much fun the narrative voice has with small town life whatever the rank. There is so much humor veining the sharp observations of human vagaries, underscoring how much Gaskell's writing had changed. She always aimed for great things, though her earlier novels (and Dickens scolded her for daring to write beyond the female writer's natural sphere of domestic life) are problematical",
            "Whilst Wives and Daughters isn't my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell, I loved the insight in to 19th century domestic life, especially the customs, relationships and descriptions of rural living.Our heroine, Molly Gibson, is unassuming and quiet, yet has an inner steely determination and steadfast values that I really appreciated. All the characters, in fact, feel like they have been drawn from life, and I particularly enjoyed the way that Mrs Gibson was characterised - she was highly irritating in places, yet I couldn't help but like her! I believe I would have felt more positively about Wives and Daughters if the plot had been tighter in places and not so rambling, but I also appreciate that it was published posthumously and so possibly not revised to Gaskell's usual standards. I'll definitely be revisiting this - especially as it is so revealing about the way in which people lived, which I always love reading about! Give me the mundane details any day; they're always the best. "

There they discover that all of the CDs are missing, even though an employee just put them out minutes before. Convinced that a thief is at work, Cam is on the case...First published in 1995, Cam Jansen and the Triceratops Pops Mystery feels quite dated - more dated even than the titles in this series from the 1980s, given the focus on a store selling video tapes, as well as on a video rental store. Beginning chapter-book readers today probably haven't ever seen a video tape! Leaving that aside, this was a fun entry in the Cam Jansen Mystery series, in which the eponymous heroine uses her photographic memory to solve crimes. The scenes with Jordan, the music store employee, and his discussion with the lady who wanted helped finding a CD whose name she couldn't remember, were particularly funny for me, as someone who has worked in retail. I'm not sure the target audience will find it as entertaining as I did, but it certainly added to my own enjoyment.

This one might not be the best choice for students today, however, because there are a lot of things in this book that children today won't be familiar with... VHS tapes, movie rental stores, and buying CDs at a store.",

            "This is an entertaining mystery in the Cam Jansen series by David A. Adler and Susanna Natti. We've read most of these books and have really enjoyed them all. This was a tricky mystery to solve and although I saw it coming, our girls were stunned. It's an entertaining story and we are looking forward to reading the few we haven't read yet. I found it interesting that this story features a music/video store. I doubt our girls have ever really spent much time in a store like this and most of our videos and music come online now. It's a bit of an older story, but still interesting. ",
            "The Cam Jansen series is perfect for young readers who are making the transition to chapter books. Although, I think this book is suspenseful enough on its own for children to be excited to read. I also think that this would be a worthy book for a teacher to read to the class, perhaps at the end of the day. Since some chapters end with a cliffhanger, teachers may find it useful to read a few chapters each day to students. Also, this would be a helpful book for teachers to use as an example for some mini-lessons (leads, suspense, foreshadowing/predicting, etc.). Also, if readers are interested, you can encourage them to continue reading more Cam Jansen books by David A. Adler since this book is part of a series. ",

            "From First To Last is a great Punisher graphic novel for first-time Punisher readers looking for an entertaining set of noncommittal stories. Each of the three stories told in this collection stand out as being some of the most interesting episodes in the Punisher's life that I can think of. The Tyger delves into the earliest influences on Frank Castle's life that would eventually mold him into the Punisher. I was able to get a much clearer picture of the Punisher after reading about his past in such detail. Most stories about Frank Castle's past entails his time in Vietnam or the moments right before he lost his family. The Tyger goes much farther back to show a young Frank Castle being molded into the merciless vigilante he would grow up to become.The Cell takes us into the greatest moment of justice in the Punisher's life. The Punisher's ingenuity and relentlessness to dole out his signature style of brutal justice shines brightly in this story. This was my favorite story of the three because of how badass it was the whole way through. The Punisher goes to the absolute most extreme lengths imaginable just to punish bad guys, and I love it!Lastly, The End closes the story of the Punisher once and for all in the most over-the-top way possible. The merciless vigilante literally goes to the ends of the Earth to carry out his punishments unto evildoers, even in the face of total world destruction. This post-apocalyptic Punisher tale is definitely the most out-there of the bunch \u2013 perhaps even the most obscure Punisher story ever written as far as I know \u2013 but it does not fail to entertain in the slightest.By providing intense action, violent imagery, and intelligent writing, The Punisher: From First To Last is able to captivate its readers the whole way through and give fans arguably the most unique set of Punisher stories ever written. This collection is easy for anyone to pick up without having to have extensive knowledge on the character beforehand, which is why I found it to be so accommodating (I haven't read much Punisher before). Whether a seasoned Punisher fan or a newbie to the franchise, you'll certainly be left wanting more after reading this collection, especially thanks to Garth Ennis' legendary take on the character.",
            "Masterful. Garth Ennis is the ultimate bad-ass comics writer, and Frank Castle, the Punisher is the ultimate bad-ass anti-hero. This book collects three one-shot comics. The first, the Tyger, drawn by comics legend John Severin, tells the story of Punisher's origin",
            "Punisher fans have the potential to be some of the dumbest people you can meet. Let me clarify, by stating that I used to be a Punisher fan when I was first getting into comics, particularly superhero comics because he seemed the most plausible. Now? Bullshit. You've got to turn on the suspension of disbelief just as much. He's often a terribly hollow and shallow characters--as such",
            "The TygerThis one is really excellent - it's a look back at the formative years of Frank Castle and the events that led him to become The Punisher. The art is great and it features a fantastic self-contained story, with allusions to William Blake's 'The Tyger'.The CellThis one is so very dark, it almost ends up being horror. It sees Frank getting himself sent to prison to hunt the ultimate group of bad men. More so than the next comic, The Cell is a brilliant epilogue or coda to Garth Ennis' run and adds some closure to Frank's grief over his family.The EndThis is the one I was actually looking forward to but I was just a little let down. The story is interesting, even though it borders on parody in it's nihilism. But the art is just dreadful at times, looking more like a weekend cartoon in a newspaper.But overall, it's well worth reading. Sadly the art in the third story loses it some marks.",
            "Nice collection of stories:The Tyger is the strongest of the three. Covering Castle's early life was a nice touch",
            "ABSOLUTE RATING: {3+/5 stars}STANDARDIZED RATING: <3/5 stars>",
            "The book collects 3 one-shot stories written by the excellent and bloody-minded Garth Ennis featuring the Punisher in various stages of his life. The first story takes place in his youth when he first encounters mobsters; the second when he turns himself in to a maximum security prison in order to gain access to some old mob bosses and assassins; the third set in the future when the world has been ravaged by nuclear war and he's on a mission to take out those responsible. They were all excellent reads but I felt the first story was a bit slow. I understand it's important to see Frank Castle as a kid to flesh out his character and give him more depth but it was still kind of dull. The second story was probably the best with Castle breaking through the various security levels of the prison, defying both guards and prisoners alike, to get to his men. It's gruesome what he does to them but sort of justified (to the character at least) because of a revelation of what they did. The third story was good as well if pessimistic. Then again that kind of death and end to Frank Castle's life felt suitable to the character. It's a great read with Ennis perfectly in tune with the character's attitude of bloody justice and the demand of the high levels of action Punisher stories require. An excellent book of stories featuring a controversial anti-hero with some great set pieces. ",
            "Pretty classy trio of distinctly hard hitting Punisher one-shots by gritty comic book writer Garth Ennis. As the title suggests the stories feature a story set during Castle's childhood, another of him getting down to business taking his revenge on the criminals responsible for the accidental killing of his family and concludes with a possible last Punisher story set some decades into the future after the bombs have destroyed civilization. The art is very well served to the genre and none of the artists pull any punches. Good stuff. I dropped a star because I'm not a great fan of the anti-heroes like the Punisher. "

Trying her best to cope with her terrifying memories and horrible nightmares, she decides to join a weekly group therapy session in her hometown of Shakespeare, Arkansas. At first, Lily can hardly believe the number of her fellow Shakespeareans that share her life experiences. As it turns out, the group members' feelings aren't the only things that need sorting out -- they assemble for a session and find a woman dead, killed in bone-chilling fashion and deliberately left on display to send a twisted message. Who would commit such horrendous crime, and who is the intended recipient of the message? Before long, Lily becomes embroiled in this disturbing murder and its aftermath, one in which the brutal killer's motives are entirely unclear. The truth is, the situation has dredged up more than a few of her own terrible secrets, and she may not be able to rest until she can untangle the who and why of this terrible crime. But can she accomplish this before the killer strikes again, and before her nightmares send her over the edge?

            "This is the fifth and final book in the series although I'm not sure when the author wrote this book if she did so with the intention of ending the series here or if it was a decision made by the publisher. Either way, you do feel a reasonable sense of closure by the time you finish the book. I do think while the series started off strong, it has run its course and it's probably for the best this was the final book.There have been some changes in Lily's life since the last book. She doesn't clean houses as much anymore for a living as she now is working for Jack. She also has begun attending group therapy sessions for survivors of horrific crimes. It wouldn't be a Charlaine Harris mystery if someone didn't get murdered, and in this one the murder victim is found by Lily at the same location as her group therapy meetings. Gee, I sure hope Lily will be able to figure out what happened by the end of the book. I loved the idea of Lily meeting with other survivors and opening up about what happened to her but I wish it had been more of a side plot and not part of the actual murder mystery. It just made me feel uncomfortable that there are all these women sharing with one another the traumatic events in their lives and then you have them stumble upon a murder victim? I just wish the author would have come up with a different storyline for the murder so these poor women could attend their therapy sessions in what should be a safe environment. The mystery itself is pretty weak but I did enjoy the parts that featured Lily's personal life. Overall, an okay conclusion to the series. ",
            "The fifth (and to my knowledge, last--I don't know if any more are forthcoming) Lily Bard book is almost more about developments in Lily's life than it is an actual crime. This is not to say that there isn't one in Shakespeare's Counselor, because there is, and a pretty warped one at that. Our heroine, now that her relationship with her lover Jack has progressed to a point where she's willing to take his suggestion to start addressing some of the issues in her life, joins a rape survivor therapy group. And is shortly thereafter confronted with a dead body, violently killed, found where her group has been meeting. At the same time, Lily learns that the counselor running the group is apparently herself getting stalked, struggling with serious issues of her own even as she's trying to help them all.Quite intense stuff there, and Harris does a good job of handling the ramifications of her plot points in her compact page count. I found it a little odd jumping to this one after recently reading the first Lily Bard (in which her original backstory is told in detail)... and yet, reading the books so close together did show a nice story arc of Lily dealing with what she's suffered as her life in Shakespeare has progressed through the five books. On the other hand, I'm not sure whether I also needed a subplot of Lily suffering a miscarriage in this book. It's handled well, like the survivor group issues, and yet it made reading it a bit too... much. So, I do still recommend this as well as the series as a whole, but with a cautionary note that the plotlines may be a bit triggery for anyone with history in these areas. Three and a half stars.",
            "Sorry to say this is the last of this series, which I have really enjoyed. Lilly Bard is a most unusual protagonist. I would love to continue to read her evolution and growth. Good supporting characters, too. It seems that I've come to like cozy mysteries. I'll take a look at Harris's other books. ",
            "This, alas, is the last of the five Lily Bard mystery novels that Charlaine Harris wrote before the Sookie Stackhouse gold mine arrived at her literary doorstep. And they are probably my favorite series of hers. The main character is a housekeeper who is living somewhat off the grid in small town Arkansas after a brutal gang rape a few years before. She fills her spare time taking karate lessons and working out with near obsessive fervor. She is also trying to make room in her solitary life for her boyfriend Jack who was introduced in the second book. After she wakes up from a nightmare to find herself choking him though, he suggests some counseling wouldn't be out of line for her. But someone in her nascent rape recovery group soon ends up dead and Lily ends up in the middle of another mystery. Some people have suggested that it's unrealistic that a housekeeper in a small town would continually stumble on murder victims and elaborate conspiracies. For me, the series is so well-written (and Lily obviously isn't ordinary in any respect) and the characters are so engaging that I don't mind or notice. You could say the same about any number of mystery novels for that matter. This book ended well and maybe that's why I like this series the best as it didn't keep grinding on till there was nothing left but memories of characters once loved that have grown tedious. Still, I'm sad there are no more Lily Bard books out there. I'd like to think though that by granting Lily some peace and happiness, Charlaine herself found some too. ",
            "This is one of the highest ratings I have given a Charlaine Harris book. It is the final book in her Lily Bard series and by far the best. It took me two books to really like Lily, because she reminded me a lot of myself. In fact, she embodied a lot of the things I wish I could change and move past. We are not identical by any means, but share similarities. Half way through this books, I knew that I had really grown to love and sympathize with her, because I found myself shedding a few tears over a loss she experiences.Though I sort of had the killer figured out, this book did a good job of making me doubt myself. I flip flopped a few times, then gave up trying to figure it out. It made the ending much more satisfying as it unfolded. There is no sense reading this book if you have not read the first 4. Lily is a package deal. You have to see who she was at the beginning to appreciate her growth by the end. It saddens me that there will not be any mre books about Lily, but at the same time, I can't see where else the series could go from here.",
            "Fun wrap up to the Lily Bard series! Lily joins a group for victims of sexual assault. Surprising to her is that she actually is enjoying it. The happy feelings fade away when the group arrives to find a grisly murder scene. A new member was brutally murdered. Is the perpetrator taunting the group or the therapist? It turns out their therapist has been the victim of a stalker. Lily and Jack are pulled right into the story. Meanwhile, Lily is taking to her new job as Jack's assistant, but she's been feeling a little sick. It was pretty obvious that she was pregnant. It was sad when she miscarried. I found it interesting the author would choose to include this particular trauma. I enjoyed this bit of fluff and can see myself returning to this series again. ",
            "And so we come to the end of the series, to find Lily now working to get her PI license alongside Jack while still cleaning part-time, and having been talked by Jack into attending a therapy group for rape survivors. Which is how she comes into contact with Tamsin Lynn, Shakespeare's Counselor and target for a particularly nasty stalker. When the stalking escalates into a woman being found dead in the therapist's office, Lily can't help but start nosing around.A decent end to a decent series, but I'm going to need a little holiday from Charlaine Harris for a while - the things that had started to bug me in the Sookie series (every man with a sex drive lusts after her, people have overheard conversations around her about how awesome she is, yada yada yada) were all present and starting to irritate - but I'm grateful that it got me through a particularly unpleasant cold without taxing my poor brain too much.",
            "Oh how I have loved this series. And I am sad that there are no more books. I hope someday Lily pops back into Ms. Harris' head and demands another book be written about her. I would be first in line to buy that one. :-)",
            "Of all the heroines in Charlaine Harris' books, I like Lily Bard the best. She is believable and grows emotionally throughout the books. I sure hope Charlaine will be writing more Lily Bard mysteries.",
            "Very dark topics are interwoven throughout this book! The plot is twistedand then twisted again with many characters hiding much of themselves. Asthis is the final book in the series, the loose ends of the plot are masterlybraided together.

            "So you have a stalker",
            "The fifth and final installment in the Lily Bard series wraps up Lily's story quite nicely. In addition to finally settling down with Jack, Lily has decided to face her past and begin attending group therapy sessions. Of course, these sessions become the scene for yet another murder in cozy little Shakespeare. And as usual, Lily is right smack in the middle of the action. As others have said, this wasn't the best in the series. I think some of that was because there weren't any loose ends to leave you craving the next book. But with Lily's settling down and everything, it did have a hint of finality to it. I for one am sorry to see her go... though I hear she may be making cameo appearances in some of Charlaine Harris's other books from time to time. :)",
            "Finally, I have managed to finish the fifth and last book in her Lily Bard series. I don't know if I liked it or not. Lily is a rape survivor, and a very angry person. She tends to see the worst in people and doesn't want to get very close to them. Over the series, we see her change a little, and admit to herself that she does have people who care for her, and that she does love Jack, who she secretly married in book 4. She cleans people's houses, takes karate lessons, helps investigate murders. I think she will continue to heal.",
            "Shakespeare's Counselor is the final book in the Lily Bard series. I was surprised to find that I took great pleasure in this series. In some ways it is one long novel",
            "This book was a bit of an upset, for me. I love the character Lily, very much. And I sincerely love that she is furthering her relationship with Jack, her love interest, and is able to hang in there and keep this new relationship afloat, without trying to screw it up (consciously or unconsciously) on purpose. I love that Lily loves Jack. But these new developments in the relationship, and the series, are completely unlike anything the characters would do, in my opinion. I was left wondering WHY.Then to have her act as she did in this novel seemed.... kinda like the author was taking massive leaps and bounds in her recovery from the past. I don't agree with these changes, I don't think this character, having gone through The Bad Thing, would have done these things, and I was rather put off at the novel because of it all.Lily would NOT have gone off and married Jack, out of the blue. She suffered from a HUGE inability to have a real relationship, much less taken a giant commitment like this - she is pretty much a commitment-phobe, because of the rape and abuse in the past.Then the author has the characters say... well we got married a month ago.... and didn't even write about it?? Or anything? man",
            "The series finale for Lily Bard ranked a disappointing 'ok' for me; Lily had been such a well-constructed heroine up to this point - she had a brutal backstory that shaped her into the person she was: wary, distrustful, solitary and standoffish. I truly believed this novel would provide her the opportunity to complete her character arc. I was not expecting a fairy godmother-like transformation but hey - a likeable Lily would have been nice. Instead she's standoffish, at times openly churlish (and unprovoked to be same) and even describes herself by saying 'I know I was being a pill' and 'I was being purposefully balky'. Ooo-kay. It's hard to cheer for a protag who is intentionally acting like an ass and doing not one thing to change or be proactive about it.Then there were the purposeless scenes - Lily's miscarriage. Another ooo-kay. What was that slid in there for? Sympathy, maybe? Very tough to give - the character was back in ass-kick mode within hours of a D&C. (which really tried the whole Willing Suspension of Disbelief, that). And then that strange dinner she and Jack had with his partners. An ex lover of Jack's literally drops in out of the blue and (again unprovoked) starts a nasty verbal catfight with Lily (who of course kicks her ass). The whole point of that scene still has me mystified and what's more is that people don't act like that! And if these two women really *did* act like that good ol' Jack would be wise to kick 'em both to the curb.As for the mystery itself, whoa. The idea of a married couple playing psychological chess with each other is very cool but the way this was executed reminded me of a suitcase being tossed together at the very last moment before the trip; some stuff needed to be there, some stuff just did not belong, and a whole lot was missing altogether. I really loved this series and had high hopes for this book. Oh well .... ",
            "Almost two weeks ago I decided to re-read the first two books of this short series. At the time I had enjoyed the first one, but been more reserved regarding the second one. As with any other book you have to be in the mood to enjoy the peculiarities of it, and I find that Harris' particular brand of habits, and ramblings, does not sit well with me most of the year.However the Lily Bard series was what I wanted, needed, these past few days, and I spent a nice time with it. I enjoyed the down to earth feeling of Lily, the description of everyday tasks (however how often can you describe a character doing the laundry in a single book, that's my question), the attentive attention given to the healing of the victim of a violent crime. I also enjoyed seing Lily evolving, and even if sometimes her thoughts and judgements were hard to sallow you could still see where they come from.There is however a particular brand of slut shaming that pervades the book, even accounting what I've mentionned before and obviously I don't enjoy it.I found that past the third book, the plots were not the best that Harris has crafted but as the books are short it's quite easy to not waffle on that.I enjoyed that she was able to wrap up most of the stuff at the end of the fifth, and wouldn't say no to a another re-read of the first ones.",
            "So sad to get to the end of this series! Maybe Harris will go back to Lily Bard as she's going back to Aurora Teagarden after many years. I listened to the whole series in less than 2 weeks! I made more time for listening than I usually do because I couldn't stop! This was a very serious book. I think it was wise for Lily to join a support group but dang, this one was a mess! It was interesting getting to know some new characters and old characters with more information. There was a lot of heartbreaking moments in this book, it was hard to listen to. Very sad to have gotten to the end of this series! I will miss Lily, Jack, Claude, Carrie, and Bobo!!",
            "Shakespeare's Counselor - the 5th book in the Lily Bard series by Charlaine Harris.Picked up this book after reading the Sookie Stackhouse series by the same author. While it's a fairly enjoyable read with plenty of action and twists that left me guessing right up until the end it's also pretty dark, with very little humour. The main character Lily is a strong woman who is working to overcome her trauma and while she's got plenty of depth I couldn't really say the same for the rest of the cast. ",
            "Well, the series didn't exactly end with a bang. I like Lily and Jack enough that it was worth the read, but this particular plot(especially the resolution) didn't do it for me. Felt like she was trying to pack too much into one book and ended up with kind of a haphazard result.More like a 2.5 star book for me, but I'm rounding up since I liked the series overall, mainly on the strength of the Lily Bard character.",
            "Another good one. Very convoluted mystery this time. It's the last one I have, thank goodness. These books are like candy. Very hard to quit reading, but not especially fulfilling. Still, they're fun.",
            "This has been a very fun series! I've loved the characters and their adventures. I highly recommend it - read from the beginning."

            "Joseph Bruchac, a Native American of Abenaki descent, is one of my all-time favorite children's authors, and I am always amazed at the almost-comprehensive catalogue of genres he has mastered. From picture books to plays, folktale collections to nonfiction, as well as historical, contemporary, fantasy and horror fiction, his work is diverse in form, but consistent in both its quality, and its commitment to issues relevant to America's indigenous peoples.Heart of a Chief is no exception. An engaging middle-grade novel, it follows the story of eleven-year-old Chris Nicola who, in addition to grappling with some very tough family issues, finds himself confronting the question of Indian mascots in his class at school, and the even thornier dilemma of gambling on his New Hampshire reservation. Bruchac handles these controversial subjects with sensitivity, particularly the issue of gambling, which has been very divisive among Native communities. Although it does address some serious problems, Heart of a Chief is a fairly optimistic book, and young readers will appreciate Chris's fair-minded, tolerant approach to life, as well as Bruchac's message that children can have a positive effect upon the world around them.",
            "As I was reading this, I tried really hard not to compare Joseph Bruchac to Sherman Alexie. That lasted about five minutes, and for the rest of the story I kept thinking, Okay",
            " Book Review September 2021  The Heart of a Chief is a novel but is based on the realities of contemporary Indian America about a kid named Chris who lives in Cook India Reservation and lives with his dad at a simple house. At school things is going great for Chris he\u2019s been selected to lead a group project on using Indian names for sports team. One emotion that I got from the book was that when Chris said \u201cThe heart of a true chief beats with the hearts of the people\u201d that got me a little bit of my eyes to tiers when reading that statement. This book may apple to people who may what to see a indian person point of view and how he needs to deal with school problems because of their mascot but also his family problems since his mom passed away and how his dad is an alcohol. In conclusion The heart of a chief is a great book to read when every you want to read it. I give it a 4 out 5 stars because of how the author Joseph Bruchac did such a great job of the book and the writings and emotions to this book has. ",
            "Things I loved about this book: contemporary native american kid, being a contemporary kid. Sensitive depiction of the Reservation -- the safety and comfort it represents to residents vs what it looks like to outsiders. Chris' strength and articulate self-expression. The fearless tackling of large issues -- the use of Native American stereotypes for sports teams, the debates over what a casino brings to a community/takes from a community, the pain of alcoholism and how it affects entire families (this is not a Native American specific issue by any means, but it is handled very well here). The way community support really makes a difference in the lives of all of the kids depicted, from the families on the rez to the school staff. The beauty of Penacook rules for meetings and coming to consensus rather than majority rules. lots. I loved lots of things about this book. ",
            "This is a great book about being an Native American in the Northeast (US) written by a Native American author. It's contemporary and addresses issues affecting our American Indian students today. It's a little cerebral in the sense that most of the main character's conflicts to overcome are in how he thinks of his family, his heritage, and fellow students in school. On the other hand, the main character's a junior high student and that's the age where we're pretty much getting in our own way anyway. It's very well written and I enjoyed both the point of view (which I need to expose myself to more) and the storyline.",
            "Genre: Historical Fiction - This book takes you through a Native American boy's journey changing the mascot at his school. I think that this is a great book, because even today, there are schools that still use indians as their mascots and have some racial chants. This book sparks a change in people",
            "Manages to remain an authentic-feeling account of life on the reservation without resorting to inappropriate language or content. Ending doesn't feel earned, though -- a little cute, somewhat after school special tone. ",
            "Good book that sheds light onto culture that isn't familiar to everyone.",
            "Chris lives on a Penacook reservation, but attends school in town. He lives with his grandfather and great Aunt after the death of his mother and the alcoholic problems of his father. Chris misses his father terribly and longs for his return. Especially since the reservation is facing the serious difficulties of unemployment and the possibility of a casino being built on their island. Meanwhile, at school, language arts class presents Chris with the opportunity of taking on another issue: using Indians as mascots for athletic teams. With Chris leading the way, his group researches a topic close to home and present their argument before their class, the principal and the school board.",
            "This book is about Chris, a young boy who lives on a Native American reservation. He is in the middle of a discussion as to whether or not their tribe should build a casino.",
            "Chris is Penacook. The native people who live on his reservation are divided over building a casino to help ease the economic stress of life on the reservation. Chris has strong feelings on the issue but he has been raised to be respectful of all opinions, and to abide by the will of the group. New at the local middle school, his first experience on at off-reservation school, Chris discovers that his calm manner and soft spoken ways are appreciated by his teachers and his classmates. When they choose him to be the leader on a class project, Chris further stirs things up when the group decides to focus their project on sports mascots and team names. Since the school team is named the Chiefs, many students are angered by the threat to their traditions.Throughout the book",
            "Bruchac's novel is moving and persuasive. He offers many issues for young readers to discuss regarding the Native American community, especially the issue of using the names of tribes for sports teams. He addresses the false tendency to think of the names as honoring the pride and strength of a native nation\u2019s heritage. The examples and the personalizing of the issue through the eyes of young Chris Nicola will engage young readers as they come to understand how even if the names intend on harm, they still do cause a deep degree of hurt. Bruchac explains how using the names of tribes degrades and makes a joke of them. This puts the issue in a quandary",
            " Heart of a Chief by Joseph Bruchac is about a boy named Chris. Chris is entering middle school but the middle school is located outside the reservation. Chris deals with his fathers alcoholism while maintaining strong ties to his family, the threat of a casino being built in the middle of the reservation, and the controversy over middle school mascot, the Chiefs. Chris is struggling with discovering who he is and where he belongs. This is a good coming of age story that highlights changes from elementary school to middle school.I thought that the book was okay. It was nothing spectacular. It was a quick read but nothing that I hadn't heard before. This book reminded me of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian but dramatic in different ways. I thought that this book was more serious than the True Diary was. The one thing I liked about it was the mix of English and Penacook. If I were to pick between the two books for my class, I would pick the True Diary. I thought that Heart of a Chief was almost boring at parts.If I were to recommend this book, I would recommend it to late elementary to early middle school students. They would relate the most to the coming of age struggles that Chris faces throughout the novel. I think that high school students would think that this book is for little kids and would rather read True Diary instead.",
            "Joseph Bruchac created a well-written and thoughtful story in The Heart of a Chief. This book offers students a different perspective as the story is told by a pre-teen Native American boy, which allows students to see and feel what he does throughout the story. The main character, Chris, shares his \u201ctwo sides\u201d throughout the story as seen, for example, in the first chapter when Chris shares information about his name in both Christian terms and beliefs and in Penacook terms and beliefs. A varied perspective is also offered when Chris and his friend Katie share their view on the holiday Thanksgiving. This text can also give rise to critical inquiry. One example being the discussion that Chris and his classmates get into of giving Indian names to sports teams. The other issue that divided the Penacook tribe was the building of a casino on their reservation. Students could initiate a discussion of casinos and the pros and cons of having one in their community. ",
            "Historical- Fiction Book #1This book was about a boy named Chris who lived in an Indian Reservation. His small tribe is known as the Penacook. His mother passed away in a fire and his dad is in rehab for alcohol. So, he is living with his extended family. The tribe wants to put a casino on their special island and it causes a lot of controversy, in the end, Chris' dad, Mito, writes a letter and gives them their land where their trailer used to be (and where the mother passed away). Another big portion of the story was about Chris and his project in his language arts class. His project is that there should be no mascots affiliated with Indians, this gets the whole city talking and they vote on a new name, which was not told in the book. ",
            "Chris lives on a fictional reservation, the Penacook reservation in New Hampshire. However, the issues he has to deal with, like the alcoholism of his father, the potential building of a lucrative casino on a sacred island, and most of all, fitting in in the sixth grade at Rangerville Junior High, are real issues facing Indian children today. He unexpectedly takes a leadership role in a group project in social studies class involving protesting the name of the school team, the Chiefs, that is disrespectful to the Indians, and learns a lot about dealing with people in authority to promote the goals of his tribe: developing the heart of a Chief.",
            "In my search for young adult books with strong Native American characters, I came across this Joseph Bruchac novel. It was written in 1998 but its themes are those that are still being addressed in Native communities today. The main character is a 6th grader living on a fictitious reservation in the northeast. Issues that are confronted alcohol abuse, tribal leadership, casino gambling and Native American mascots. While it doesn't delve deeply into any of these, it is a great starting point. It is a quick read and the readability is probably somewhere near the 5th grade. I would definitely recommend this to my 6th grade students.",

            "This book is the basis for the Alan Moore comic (and thus - loosely - the lamentable Johnny Depp vehicle) From Hell, and as an appreciator of the comic, I figured I would never have an reason to bother reading the original history it was based on. Then I ran into it one Saturday in a used bookstore, and what can I say, I'm a sucker for old paperbooks.Stephen Knight gives a journalistic account of the Ripper murders, which is to say he acquaints you with a lot of the facts of the case, while also making a sustained argument for his particular (and particularly outlandish) interpretation of their meaning. I'm given to understand this is widely discredited now as being a product of his (and his main informant's) paranoias about the Freemasons, albeit bringing to light some formerly overlooked facts of the case in the process. Regardless of all these details about being a plausible or historical account",
            "Overwhelming! The author started with a crazy story told to him by an elderly man, decided to look into it, and virtually re-investigated the entire Jack The Ripper case. The answers he came up with tie up every loose end and unlikely suspect I ever heard of related to the events of 1888 -- and every Ripperologist knows there are many of those indeed. Alas, every word of it is crap, but that doesn't mean it isn't my favorite theory to date. Patricia Cornwell shamelessly ripped off Stephen Knight's hard work in her own, much sillier and less likely solution to the Ripper case.",
            "Even though most people don't beleive it, I believe it does solve the identity of the killer. A riveting true crime story deeply entrenched in social class. Be forewarned the writing style is overly academic and very wordy in style, very, very hard to read but worth pouring over to discover who the Ripper is.",
            "Knight wrote a rather interesting book on the Freemasons ('The Brotherhood'), this book is interesting, but its conclusions have been shattered by contemporary evidence. The late Mr. Knight writes well, though, and it is the basis for so many people believing the Royal Family were involved. Misguided, but still worth a read, oddly.",
            "All the known facts are interwoven into a theory that points to Royal involvement in the ripper story. It's quite a convincing tale but somewhat fanciful. Not, in my opinion, the final solution but a fun one. The comic book and film From Hell draw in this theory too.",
            "proof!",
            "Stephen Knight has written a very engrossing book that sheds some light on murder suspect Walter Sickert, but then proposes many outlandish and wild theories that do little if any justice for the victims. There is no proof at all that Sickert was a member of the Freemasons or even the Hermetic Order Of The Golden Dawn. Whether Joseph Gordon (who claims his real name is Joseph Sickert) is really the son of Walter Sickert or not cannot be proven. And if Sickert was truly evil, as this theory originally proposes, he would have tried to cast blame on the innocent and hide his own guilt in the end by telling lies and not the truth...",
            "Having just finished the book I have not had time to mull over my review as long as I have with the others, but I must mention how well constructed the Sickert case is, even though the last chapter has a strong air of simple theorising to it. A fascinating, in-depth look at one of the strongest cases I've come across so far, although heavy with conspiracy and incredibly unlikely events and circumstances. ",
            "Basically the Royal/Freemason conspiracy which became the basis of alan Moores from hell, a fun read if discredited and at least as likely as the Patricia Cornell one, In fact good old Walter Sickert features in both!!",
            "Read it as entertainment and you won't be disappointed. Don't take the title too literally. its A final solution, not THE final solution. And an implausible, if ingenious, solution at that. For fans of conspiracy theories, this one's a corker. High on speculation and leaps of logic, low on believability. But Knight puts forward his arguments with gusto and confidence. He writes well, and this is an engrossing book. Did it bring me round to his ideas on the Ripper's identity? Not at all. However, if you enjoyed the film/comic book From Hell, you may be interested to see the main source of inspiration. ",

For as long as I could remember, I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack The Ripper. So, when I made my first trip to London, Whitechapel was a must for me. I didn't do a tour, I wanted to experience it all for myself first hand. Stephen Knight's book was a perfect road map for me, and it even helped me find Sir William Gull's grave in the tiny churchyard cemetery, in Thorpe-Le-Soken, in Essex. While I look back on the book today and realize, it's pretty much all hogwash, it still provides solid details to locations, the players involved and does present a compelling argument. This book sits proudly in my library along side all my other collections of book on the subject of Jack The Ripper. ",
            "Crazy-ass theory attributing the Whitchapel murders to none other than Queen Victoria's physician extraordinary Sir William Withey Gull.

It was a fierce thunderstorm as was the battle between then. I appreciate that. These books are too young for the Niece and the nephew. The Niece is going to let me borrow a graphic novel she likes and I can review that and tell you what she thinks too. I think an 80s Berenstain bears story is still some good stuff. I love thinking of living inside a tree. ",

The bad day turns into a string of bad days, to the point that they don\u2019t even remember what they were fighting about. Though this is not our kiddos favorite in the series, it does a very good job of addressing sibling fights. It explains that it is just part of living with people, even those you care about deeply, but also talks about how to resolve them well.

            "It drove me crazy that the author called him Abe throughout the book. He hated the name Abe and refused to go by it. It also feels too casual to call a president a nickname throughout a book with occasional formal names and titles. Additionally, I felt the author was often negative in some of the story telling. I doubt that General Grant was puffing cigars the entire war. Mentioning that some saw his Gettysburg Address as a \u201cwet blanket\u201d was unnecessary nor helpful in explaining the importance and significance of his speech. Those are just a few examples. I wasn\u2019t impressed.",
            "As a huge Lincoln fan - I like this book. Not the best picture book about him but I really enjoyed the art work. The writing was at times a bit off-putting but the facts were there. The author refers to Lees army as \u201cgallant\u201d - but gives no praise for the Federal Troops. ",

It covers the years 1837-1865. The book features beautiful, detailed illustrations that support the dense written text. The book is written in story format, but includes dates and specific historical facts. The first page begins with encouraging the reader to think back to the president and imagine his life. As the book goes on, it is organized by time period. It begins with Lincoln\u2019s arrival to Springfield, Illinois where he was a practicing lawyer who helped the people. The story also talks about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s marriage and family life. The book also discusses the issue of slavery and its effect on the country. On these pages, an illustrious map is included showing all of the different trails and train lines, as well as using a color key to show which states had slavery. The book also talks about Lincoln\u2019s run for Senate, and his loss to the other candidate, an event that is not frequently covered in history class. After this, the majority of the book is about Lincoln\u2019s presidency. The book also does a thorough job of covering the Civil War and important battles during this war. In addition, Lincoln\u2019s life during his presidency is also depicted with detail. The book even includes the full Gettysburg Address. The book ends with Lincoln\u2019s assassination.As someone who has always been interested in Abraham Lincoln, I would definitely use this book in my curriculum. For individual or guided reading, it would need to be used with middle school grades, 5th grade being the youngest. However, I would use it as a supplemental read aloud for younger grades. The pictures are beautiful, intricate and engaging, and the text is written in a way to make history sound like an interesting story for students. I think this is a great resource and a great way to get different students interested in history. This would fit well in a unit on presidents or the Civil War. ",
            "An excellent resource on the adult life of Lincoln, focusing on the events leading up to and during his presidency. Author touches on family, business and political life. The narrative captures not only the mood of the president during the Civil War, but also the mood of the country. Bright and colorful illustrations including maps, battle scenes, big moments in Lincoln's life, his family and contemporaries. There is great attention to detail in all illustrations. Maps are filled with information including place names, borders, major event details, etc. Captions include additional information about the illustrations, such as names and dates of battles, names and titles of people and additional details of events. Includes full text of the Gettysburg address. Additional resources: Bibliography, National Geographic url, address and contact information for Lincoln's homesite in Springfield, Illinois.",
            "Abraham Lincoln was an incredibly influential and inspiring man that changed our country forever. This National Geographic book depicts the adult life of Lincoln in great detail; and even draws in some of the youngest readers. This book is jam-packed with information not only on this man, but also on the Civil War. I could have spent hours looking at the in-depth illustrations as they include extra information about the various events and people that pop in this book. I also enjoyed that Harness included the down-sides of Lincoln's life such as losing elections and the loss of many close family members. This great book informs young readers as well as older readers of this incredible man that brought about some of the biggest changes to our nation. ",
            "Abe Lincoln goes to Washington would fit well in any Civil War unit quite nicely. It has some good information on the role of children in Abe Lincoln's life that would provide children in a primary or middle grades classroom greater access and interest into larger events - which is always good thing. Overall it follows the basic canon of Abe Lincoln's life, but for a class that does not have this information the book could be very helpful. ",
            "The illustrations are awesome. The book was well-written history, however the book did seem to be overwhelming with the information and illustrations. The book would definitely tie in nicely with history in the middle grades.",
            "Abe has finally been elected president and then a war begins. Reasons I like this book-Reason 1- The book was a very short easy read.Reason 2- I learned about when Abe Lincoln was at the White House.Reason 3- The book has good illustrations. "

Suddenly with no place to hide from the reality we realize life is all cracked up. Through the lens of our pain everything seems broken, bruised, and battered. But, as best-selling author Patsy Clairmont points out, there's a redeemer of our pain--Jesus. The Redeemer of the broken and discarded who mends our hearts, and even gives us a reason to laugh again.Telling inspirational stories of women's brokenness and healing, with tenderness and her trademark humor, Patsy Clairmont helps us realize that we're not alone in our struggles.

        "description": "It was once the job of Madame Agathe-Sidonie Laborde to read books aloud to Marie-Antoinette. Now exiled in Vienna, she looks back twenty-one years to the legendary opulence of Versailles and meticulously reconstructs July 14, 15, and 16 of 1789.  When Agathe-Sidonie is summoned to the Queen's side on the morning of the 14th, Versailles is a miniature universe, sparkling with every outward appearance of happiness and power, peopled with nobles of minutely calibrated rank, and run according to a hundred-year-old ritual called the Perfect Day. But with the shocking news that someone has woken the King in the night, order begins to disintegrate and word of the fall of the Bastille seeps into court. Soon Versailles's beauty is nothing more than a shell encasing rising panic and chaos. Agathe-Sidonie watches as the Queen's attempts to flee are aborted; her most intimate friend betrays her; and the King, appearing to sleepwalk through this crisis, never alters his routine of visiting the Apollo Salon several times a day to consult a giant crystal thermometer.  From the tiniest garret to the Hall of Mirrors, where Marie-Antoinette stands alone and terrified in the dark, Chantal Thomas shows us a world on the edge of oblivion and an intimate portrait of the woman who, like \"fire in motion,\" was its center.",

            "Recently the UK\u2019s Mail Online ran an article entitled, \u201cDo you have Celebrity Worship Syndrome?\u201d along with a quiz \u201cto measure the reader\u2019s \u2018CWS\u2019 symptoms\u201d. One of the T/F quiz statements was, \u201cI enjoy watching my favourite celebrity\u201d; another read, \u201cI have a special bond with my celebrity.\u201dThe piece put me in mind of Chantal Thomas\u2019s engrossing historical novel, Farewell, My Queen, which I\u2019d just finished reading. The link in my thought loop can probably be traced to Thomas\u2019s description of life at Versailles, circa 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution\u2014a time when celebrity worship remained enshrined in decades-old court ritual; a place where courtiers never ceased obsessing over the high and mighty or stopped touting their connections to the court\u2019s most celebrated residents, Louis XVI and his glamorous but vacuous Queen, Marie Antoinette.To my mind, Thomas\u2019s novel makes a good case that answering in the affirmative to any of the The Mail\u2019s CWS quiz statements would have been as risky to body and soul in 18th century France as it would be practically anywhere today. One could argue, as perhaps Thomas intended, that mindless celebrity worship, especially when celebrity is undeserved or ill bestowed, was and is a waste of time and human potential. However, that premise, even if proven, would not lessen the appeal of Thomas\u2019s fictional account of Marie Antoinette\u2019s Versailles. Rather, Farewell, My Queen manages to be one of those guilty literary pleasures (the emphasis on \u2018literary\u2019 is intentional) akin to soaking up an especially well-produced episode (if there ever was such a thing) of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. That is because Thomas packs her novel with enough glamour, enough excess, enough suspense\u2014enough insider information\u2014to inspire fresh interest in a tale whose conclusion is no mystery.It helps that, besides being a gifted writer, Thomas is well qualified to take on her subject. An expert in 18th century literature and a scholar of French history, she gets down to business quickly by introducing Agathe-Sidonie Laborde, the novel\u2019s first-person narrator. An all but invisible court functionary, Laborde provides a fly on the wall perspective of the French Court during the early days of the revolution (Thomas adds a soup\u00e7on of irony by making her narrator a lowly \u201creader to the Queen\u201d).First encountered in 1810, some twenty years after the Queen\u2019s execution, Laborde is living the life of an elderly exile in Vienna. Yet neither time nor distance can diminish the image of the woman she still calls \u201cmy Queen.\u201d A dyed-in-the-wool royal groupie, Laborde begins her narrative by attempting to replace a queen known for her profligacy, who even at the height of her powers was deeply unpopular, with a rose-petal-pink goddess\u2014kind, fragrant, beautiful, \u201ca light that never goes out.\u201dThat she fails in the attempt can be attributed to a classic case of mission creep.Laborde\u2019s starry-eyed portrait of Marie Antoinette as a beautifully turned out, gentle sovereign\u2014a Queen who dispenses kindness to courtiers and servants alike\u2014is richly detailed. Yet, the narrator\u2019s idyll shatters when she begins to include the less savory aspects of court life. It turns out that one of the entrancing afternoons Laborde recounts\u2014hours spent observing the Queen thumb the pages of a fashion magazine\u2014occurred simultaneous to the storming of the Bastille. Likewise, the royal banquets Laborde describes (\u201cfour main courses, twenty side dishes, six joints of meat, fifteen regular desserts, thirty little desserts, a dozen platters of pastry\u2026\u201d) are either gobbled by the royals\u2014or in the Queen\u2019s case, picked over and discarded; meanwhile, ordinary French citizens starve to death. According to Laborde, even the gilded cages at the royal zoo house sickly, neglected animals.And then there are the narrator\u2019s memories of the palace itself, Louis XIV\u2019s magnificent ch\u00e2teau famed for its Hall of Mirrors, for its richly appointed apartments, its priceless paintings and statuary. Laborde\u2019s Versailles, however, is (literally) a seat of pestilence: its beautifully furnished rooms, infested by rats; its lavish gardens constructed upon reclaimed swamplands still swarming with mosquitoes. In fact, Thomas repeatedly invokes the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s deceptive splendor as a metaphor for what ails the court and the country. Everywhere, it seems, there is decay and corruption lurking just below a pretty fa\u00e7ade\u2014a fa\u00e7ade that is only a few days away from destruction.Things go south in a hurry when King Louis XVI submits to the National Assembly and dismisses his foreign army.Left unprotected at the wide-open ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, the courtiers panic as news of the countrywide riots spreads. The Paris mob is on the march, headed for the ch\u00e2teau, a list of \u201c286 heads that have to fall\u201d in hand. In short order, the freeloading nobility, like rats from a sinking ship, flee the palace.But not Louis, the stout little man who never wanted to be King, who prefers forging locks in the royal smithy to the tedious rituals of the court and the incomprehensible duties of government. And not his (in)famous Queen.In a final act of courage, the royal couple remains at Versailles to meet their fate.Laborde narrates these final days paying particular witness to the frazzled and dazed Queen as she rallies to arrange the flight of her favorites, including Laborde herself, who eventually escapes to Switzerland.The novel\u2019s conclusion is sudden, providing little in the way of closure. But perhaps that is an appropriate narrative choice on the author\u2019s part. In fact, it may be that Farewell, My Queen demonstrates how quickly things can come crashing down\u2014no matter how celebrated, or deeply entrenched in seemingly unassailable ritual and/or culture.Surely this remains a worthwhile aide-m\u00e9moire in the twenty-first century given how the powerful (and those who idolize them) are just as apt as ever to be blinded by the klieg light glare of celebrity. So disastrously blind, in fact, that sometimes they cannot discern how fragile is the foundation upon which their illusions rest.___Farewell, My Queen, by Chantal Thomas; First published in the U.S. 2003 by George Braziller, Inc.Originally published in France 2002 by \u00c9ditions du Seuil under the title Les Adieux \u00e0 la Reine.___Jack A. Urquhart is the author of several works of fiction, including the recently published short story, They say you can stop yourself breathing.",
            "This is not historical fiction. This is literary fiction. I could not put this down to save my life. After seeing the film, which was beautiful in its own regards, I had to purchase this (if only I read French well enough!). Both are incredibly different, and yet, incredibly enjoyable. And while the movie is delicious and glamorous, moving and one I cannot wait for on DVD, this has a beauty, life, and suspense to it that cannot be recreated on film. Agathe lives and breathes and in her own almost childlike way adores the Queen in such a way that you cannot help but feel a rush of emotions with every live. I recommend this both to Francophiles, history fans, those who adore mentions of the glamorous past, and lovers of literature alike. ",
            "In high school, I learned that those who don't remember the past are doomed to repeat History in the summer. An affecting new novel about the French revolution, by Chantal Thomas, encourages me to hope that the day must not be far off when desperately bored students will storm the bastille of textbook publishers and usher in a new era of history education. It's time heads rolled, instead of resting on the desk.Farewell",
            "This was absolutely brilliant. Given, I did pick it up once I had seen the movie trailer (but only because I didn't know it existed beforehand, for I am deeply attached to this particular era), but I came to like it for different reasons than I had been expecting. From a typically non -fiction author, this book is packed with facts and yet it still manages to flow. Once you begin the book you are taken through the sorted memories of a girl who was once Marie Antoinette's personal reader. You meet several lesser known but great personalities of Versailles as you get a sense of both the panic and the dismissal of the impeding danger. You are pushed through the events along with the girl. I would suggest you keep reading, even if you picked up the book to see Marie Antoinette's relationship with Gabrielle du Polignac, the beginning may be a little slow but the end is far from disappointing, in fact, I was crying with empathy as I squealed with exitement.

            "Les adieux \u00e0 la reine est un roman sur la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise naissante. La protagoniste, entich\u00e9e de la reine Marie-Antoinette, repr\u00e9sente une autre image de la Cour de France. Il ne s'agit plus d'un Versailles des nobles, avec le couple et la famille royale au sommet de la pyramide sociale. Devant les yeux du lecteur se dessine l'image d'un autre Versailles, d'un Versailles des subalternes, des couloirs et des passages secrets, connus seulment aux initi\u00e9s. C'est pourquoi, \u00e0 mon avis, ce roman n'est pas un roman de plus sur Marie-Antoinette. Oh non, il est bien plus. Il s'agit aussi de Versailles, ce lieu artificiel o\u00f9 Louis XIV a plac\u00e9 sa cour. Et comme Versailles a connu ses gloires, m\u00eame avant le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement officiel en 1682, ce roman t\u00e9moigne de sa d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Un monde entier, priv\u00e9 du reste de la France, s'est effondr\u00e9 en quelques jours. On assiste aussi \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e de la panique parmi les nobles locataires du Ch\u00e2teau, au commencement de l'exil, \u00e0 tout ce que Georges Lefevbre qualifiera plus tard comme La Grande Peur.En 2012, le film avec le m\u00eame titre a \u00e9t\u00e9 tourn\u00e9.

This biography, a true folk tale from a culture now in crisis, can be read on several levels: a personal and moving introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, it is also a profoundly detailed guidebook in the search for consciousness. It presents the quest for spiritual perfection, tracing the path of a great sinner who became a great saint. But it is also a powerful and graphic folk tale, full of magic, disaster, feuds, deceptions, and humor. This definitive translation, originally published in 1977, was the first to appear in any Western language in half a century and renders this classic of spiritual literature into a simple modern English that reflects the direct power of the original.",

            "The first time that I read someting relating to Milarepa was in the novel The sea the sea by Iris Murdoch. A bit curious I tried to find something but that was hard at that time. Now that has changed and information can be found. I think that the book gives a good impression of the life of Milarepa.",
            "Mila was the original bad boy, cast black magic spells for the hell of it, generally nailed his karma as much as possible, killed, lied, stole, he did it all...The story of his moments of truth, conversion to Buddhism and then subsequent roads to great master and inspirational teacher is very exciting, full of surprise, and even shot through with songs, since he was able to spontaneously compose and sing poems.Anyone who thinks their karma is way too far gone to look at any religion should read this book. You'll have an inspiration. Thank you to Jacqui who bought this for my 30th birthday.",
            "The first six chapters of this book tells the macabre story of Milarepa's trials to gain initiation into Marpa's dharma teachings, including the stone tower building episode in chapter five, one of the most famous scenes in world religion literature. The latter half is colored by his famous poems. The last chapter could stand on its own as a single short work. Tibetans often wrote better literature than philosophy, here's some of the best, it's literature it's not self-help or philosophy or religion. It's literature, and it should be read as such. This should be seen along its true peers: Paradise Lost, Crime and Punishment, The Diven Comedy",
            "You know how we sometimes slip into a deep and excited conversation so that you are saying gravity isn't real because Issac Newton also believed in alchemy and half the population of astrophysicists in the world who didn't make time to attend their mother's funeral will commit seppuku when they finally find definite proof that gravity isn't actually a fundamental force and your friend replies that that's straight out of a Rick and Morty episode but you ignore that to say Albert Einstein was wrong too because time isn't real either so that your friend rolls his eyes and asks as to what things are real, and you answer that nothing is, everything is human made and that it sure sounds like nihilism but it's totally true because Buddha himself taught one should question everything and come to one's own conclusion to which your friend shakes his head and gives you a look as if to regard you an utter disappointment to have thus far housed a human brain, says you have got it all ass up, and questions as to the kind of books have you been reading lately, but you also notice he is working himself up to that rabid mania in which he feverishly lectures you on religion and morality and there seldom seems to be escape so you quickly blurt out, Do you know what this country needs?

            "This is a very short novel, a novella really, only 124 pages. It is written as a narrative from a second person, to the main protagonist, who is already dead as the book is written.Hillbrow is a very violent suburb of Johannesburg in South Africa, and the title of the book is very ironic, as there is definitely nothing welcoming there at all. Almost every character in the book dies at some point, by all kinds of different means. Suicide, murder, AIDS, witchcraft...you name it.But is is till an interesting read and as it is very short, you can read it in an hour or two, so, as such, it is definitely worth your while.",
            "This was a really interesting book that I enjoyed a lot. It is very brief only containing 124 pages but the amount of substance that is fit into such a short book is extraordinary. It deals with topics such as xenophobia, racism, rumor, discrimination, poverty, AIDS, and crime all within its covers. Another thing that sets the book apart is the second person narration that talks not back to the reader but to the protagonist of the story who has already passed when the book begins. It chronicles the events leading to his death revealing the entire picture in starts and stops that jump around a bit but add to the allure. This is a great book to spend an afternoon reading. It is quick but also carries a lot of weight. I highly recommend it.",

            "And so, South African season kicks off. I've been meaning to read this since picking it up in Joburg a few years ago and getting suddenly 'back into' things South African on reading Mr Flanery's (okay, he's American) wonderful novel, 'Absolution' (which itself reminded me of the unique conditions and rawness of SA literature - which is why I find it so darn interesting). Here's a short, lyrical little number set among Hillbrow migrants, but focusing as much on where they've migrated from. It takes us too to Oxford (in fact, there was something perhaps unintentionally touching about how 'Oxford' in this case meant 'Oxford Brookes'. NB I went to UCL). I'm absolutely fascinated by what happened to Hillbrow (having gone through it in a taxi and been strongly advised to be terrified), so am very easy to please on this front. It's all there: crime, AIDS, xenophobia, drugs, suicide - but of course this is also a tale of love, betrayal and rural superstition. A distinctive, street-inflected voice - often surprisingly funny (especially when we get sexual and head to the 'Southern regions' and things carnal). Linguistically and metaphorically pretty interesting too, to a UK reader (the idea, for example of 'the other bone of my heart'). So, touching and lyrical. Next up (or next-up-but-one): The Restless Supermarket (which I suspect might Do Good Hillbrow too).",
            "Suicidal ideation on a large scale? Did the author actually kill himself at 34 or was there a different cause of death?I just couldn't really get fully into it. I didn't love the writing style. I don't know. I thought it would somehow be better..Have more to it.",
            "Mpe was a literary painter of note. Saddening that he did not live long enough to write more novels. I enjoyed the style of his writing more than the story. The protagonist's omniscient voice puts the reader to a quizzical and introspective perspective.",

I loved the characters and loved how the book seemed to be coming from a collective voice and predicted perspective. I think there's so much value in this book if you read into the words in addition to just reading it from face value. I took a more academic/literature deconstruction of this book. I enjoyed this read as it was initally something I wasn't super familiar with. The only thing I kind of got lost in was some of the descriptions. I don't know the area well and sometimes I felt as though the descriptions of places let my mind drift in away from what I was reading. That being said, that is a difficulty I have with reading particularly descriptive passages and books.",
            "This remarkable novel employs a distinctive narrative voice drawn from the oral traditions of the author's home community (Limpopo Province) to explore complex questions of urban social problems, xenophobia and modern literary concerns in post-Apartheid South Africa. The communal narrator addressing the dead main character from both the physical and the metaphysical reality may seem to belay the sophistication of the plot structure, but in truth it heralds what was, at the time, an exciting new way of telling stories.

Four decades later, she was revered as their leader by thousands of churches in the U.S. and Europe, had founded a national newspaper, and had become probably the most powerful woman in America.Who was this astonishing woman, the mother of the Mother Church? How did she prepare for her illustrious career during her years of obscurity, and what was her inspiration for the healing practices and doctrine of Christian Science? Gillian Gill, a non-Christian Science Scientist scholar, who managed to win unparalleled access to the Church archives, offers here an entirely new look at Mary Baker Eddy.For the first time readers will see the extraordinary leadership skills exercised by Mrs. Eddy despite the repressive forces facing women in her time. For the first time we learn the full story of the bizarre attack on Mrs. Eddy by Joseph Pulitzer and his New York World\u2014alleging that she was at least senile and possibly not even alive. In this enthralling biography, we rediscover Mary Baker Eddy as a radical Christian thinker, pioneer in the recognition of mind/body connections, survivor of scandal, and target of both admiration and scorn from such eminent contemporaries as Mark Twain. Gillian Gill's sense of drama, her critical acumen, and her delicious wit bring to life a brilliant religious leader whose message has new meaning in our time.",

            "Not so much a biography as a history of Mary Baker Eddy and the times in which she lived, which influenced many of her activities and decisions. It is certainly a wonderfully researched, well documented, and objective ('warts and all') examination, if not a little dry in some spots. In the end, though, she emerges most human; complex and inconsistent, but with an insatiable desire to devote herself to studying the Science she discovered.",
            "This description of a woman who started out life penniless and homeless, and who in her middle years founded a religion which is still going strong decades after her death, is astonishing. It is also well documented due to the Christian Science church having given the author unprecedented access to their archives. The wealthy, elderly Ms. Eddy ended up becoming the nemesis of Mark Twain, of all people on earth--which only goes to prove that reality is stranger than fiction.",
            "Fascinating portrait of an era and one of the few female leaders of the time. ",
            "This is a very long book - 520 pages of text plus 180 pages of footnotes plus an unusable index (names with long lists of page numbers). It gives all the information about Mary Baker Eddy that would satisfy any reader, but it is written in an academic style - rather dry. And facts and presumptions aren't enough.Gill spent about 40% or more of the book refuting statements made by other biographers, leaving me to feel that I should have read all of those books first so I would understand her references. Mentioning other biographies so often is unnecessary and jumbles up the author's message. Why not just state your own research? Gill used different names for Mary Baker Eddy depending on which husband she was married to. This was ultra-confusing because there are many Marys in the book as well as many Glovers and Pattersons. and referring to Mary Glover or Mary Patterson or Mary Eddy caused a great deal of concentrated effort to keep track of exactly which person Gill was meaning. Why not just use MBE? And",
            "Such clear writing, taking a controversial subject and making it easy to understand - especially her way of recognizing all the different sources and previous bios of MBE. Read her book of Florence Nightingale, and really appreciated the feminist perspective she brought to that subject, and her perspective for MBE was especially appealing to me. Too often, I think, we guys do not understand what women, and especially 19th women went through.Her description of the steps she took to get (almost full) access to the archives of the Mother Church, really had the feel of investigative journalism. I knew of her, from my youth, but being told she may have been the most powerful women in the early 20th Century really amazed me, but, with 800,000 followers and a (relative) fortune, I can see it. Gillian Gill captured, I believe, her drive, cantankerousness, philosophy, but, more important, she told one hell of a great story. One needs no background in Christian Science to really enjoy this book.",
            "As thorough a biography as is possible. The Church of Christ, Scientist, still keeps a close watch on Eddy's papers. Gill saw some but not all, which makes her achievement here all the more remarkable. Eddy has long been a target of character assassination. Her rationalist bent in theology often appears ridiculous to the non-believer. How much more puzzling to the outsider then is the fact this woman single-handedly created one of the larger Christian denominations in the U.S. by herself during a time when women could not even vote? And that she didn't even start doing so until her late forties and two marriages? Gill does battle with Eddy's scoffers and their existing canon of anti-hagiography by defending Eddy as a person and, more importantly, as a woman without succumbing into religious adoration or skirting (so to speak) tough issues. A recommended read.",
            "Hello! This author does an in depth look into many sides of Mary Baker Eddy and presents a good read for those who are aware of this wonderful woman and those who are not familiar with her hard life. ATK",
            "Ms Gill unfortunately writes more as an apologist for Eddy than a biographer.",
            "Mary Baker Eddy is a tricky person to get a handle on, and Gill presents here the most scholarly, objective overview in a very long and fraught canon of Eddy biography. This definitely supersedes Robert Peel's three volume biography, which was good for its time but is outdated and tends toward hagiography.Gill was hampered by limited access to sources, though she had more than any non-Church biographer ever has, and by a limited understanding of the Christian Science faith itself, but no one can say she did the job halfway. This is an exhaustive undertaking and not an easy read; it will take you some time. The writing style tends toward the ponderous and the speculative (almost a necessity with a figure as controversial and slippery as Eddy) and Gill inserts far too much of herself into the text.That is not to say this is a bad book; it's really quite good. Just that any reader should have an idea of its flaws in mind, and that the definitive biography of Eddy has yet to be written."

            "Abulhassan, an elderly pharmacist and favorite of the sultan, assists the Prince of Persia and the sultan's favorite mistress Shemselnehar to escape to Spain.Set in 800 AD in the City of Peace (today's Baghdad!) in the reign of sultan Harun, known for his appreciation and patronage for architecture, art, textiles, science and literature, this novel is rich in imagery. The bazaars, streets and palaces of Baghdad, then one of the largest cities, are exotic and mesmerizing and finely drawn. Horch has done his research and presents a compelling picture of customs, religion, superstition, clothing, and peoples.I did struggle, however, with the characters and their motivations, namely Abulhassan, the protagonist; thus my lower rating. The sultan was his oldest friend; he was trusted implicitly by the sultan, who in his way displayed his love for Shemselnehar. We're meant to understand that his newest friend, the Prince of Persia, was like a son to him and thus his motivation for aiding the betrayal of the sultan, but it wasn't convincing. Are we meant to believe that he was living vicariously through his young friend and finding true, romantic love, something he hadn't had w/ his wife of 50+ years? That he was making up time, that he was throwing his traditional caution to the wind and having one last blowout? This didn't ring true; he wasn't sympathetic and his honesty via omission grated.",
            "This book is what happens when I wander into a bookstore with eleven dollars in my pocket and this strange desire to buy something. It is the story of an aging pharmacist in an arabic country, set in the distant past, and how he fell back in love with the concept of love while double-crossing an old friend to help to lovers elope. Convoluted? A little. It's also a bit slow at times. But it's an elegant little story with a bit to say on love in the later stages of life/marriage. ",
            "When you find yourself on a bridge halfway between hell and the place where your judgment awaits? I'll try and explain exactly what I mean; this story is narrated from Abdulhassan's view, he's an old pharmacist, the best friend of the Sultan with whom they play chess and discuss life. The Sultan trusts only him and as a man with the power to take life and pardon people, he's most gracious towards his friend.Now, the Prince of Persia, while at Abdulhassan's shop meets the Sultan's mistress and it's love for the two young people and now Abdulhassan finds himself caught between betraying the trust of his friend and letting the two young people elope and start a life outside the country. Whatever decision he takes he can surely pay with his life and that of his family and the story is more in line with him trying to make peace with himself while deciding what to do.It's beautifully narrated and you cannot help but love how the author spins the webs of palace intrigue, servants gossip and a rich culture.",
            "Interesting to hear the context of the city in the background.",
            "There are never enough books on my shelf or at least Goodreads profile that are taken from the 1,001 Nights/Arabian Nights/I don't actually know the proper accepted title. To be fair, I've only read a couple of the legit ones myself, and that was years and years ago. Still. I'm about up to here with Greek retellings. I was in the mood for some good old-fashioned Arabian Nights fun. This both satisfied the craving and made me want more.I hesitate to commend the realism/detail of the book because, as far as I know, Horch is neither native to the regions he's writing about nor does he have an impressive PhD or anything in the subject. But a guy can do research, and I hope his (apparently abundant) research is all legit, because I haven't felt so immersed in a historical fiction novel in a couple Middle Earth ages. The alchemy, the stories-within-stories, the religion, the social customs. It all felt so /real/, both similar to some stereotypes but also smashing some stereotypes to bits. Complicated, real, messy, but also heavenly in a way.Shemselnehar is a wonderful character, and I wish the prince had her level of characterization, because they would really have been precious if I had known the prince better. But he's not even present for a lot of the book, so it's hard to get a read on him as the story progresses. I love, however, Abulhassan's entire family. Fatima is wonderful. It's true that the women in this story are all wives or mothers or both, but that doesn't restrict how great they were. In a relatively short novel, it's hard to get in-depth character development, but it didn't matter, because they felt /real/ anyway, real and complex and human. Along those lines, the sultan! This book managed to make the crusty, lusty old sultan a mildly sympathetic character, while retaining his... well, his patriarchal grossness. I don't know. His story made me sad, because it's obvious that he could have been better; could have deserved better. But people are what they are and sometimes things and people just can't be fixed.All in all a great story - a bit rushed, perhaps, but that's part of its 1,001 Nights charm, I think - it has the fairytale aura. A book I want on my real physical shelves, and a book which will hopefully lead me to other such stories (especially ones written by actual real-life Muslims and people from the Middle East). ",
            "Set in Baghdad many centuries ago, this was mostly a sweet story about a respected pharmacist trying to help a young couple who are in love be happy together forever after. Unfortunately, one of the couple is already the sultan's favorite concubine, and the sultan is the pharmacist's friend and a good man. The pharmacist does his best to be true to all, including his own wife and family, and there's a happy ending for many characters, but as happens in any love triangle - someone will be left alone. It was one of the better fiction books I've read in the past year, although there were occasional points of confusion (did Jafar sleep with the queen?) and I was hoping they'd all somehow find a happy ending.",
            "This gorgeous tapestry of a story, set in the fabled and magical City of Peace of a 9th century that never was, is about love, and alchemy, and death, and faith. The atmospheric detail is rich and striking, from the wonders of the sultan's palace gardens to the incense and rosewater with which the men perfume their beards. Abulhassan the pharmacist, in many ways a secondary character to his own story, is wonderfully sympathetic and real. His inner struggle between the loyalty he owes to his oldest friend, who is also his lord, and the love for his newest, whom he regards as a son, is profound. This was a beautiful book-- it was like having a novel-length Arabian Nights tale.",
            "Rich and vivid descriptions. Easily you can picture the setting and feel it through your senses. Yet at times I found myself getting bored with the old man's dreams. I also felt frustrated that the mistress waited so long, it seemed to stupid to me. Her reluctance and disregard was so immature. I felt glad that everything worked out so happily"

            "This interesting fable is one of Sam's favorites. The monster is so ugly that no animal can bear to be near him. His breath makes grass wither. If he stands in a stream, it dries up, and if he looks at the sky it starts snowing. But inside, the monster is just scared and lonely. In desperation, he carves stone statues to keep him company.Even stone, it turns out, is no match for his ugliness; when he opens his mouth, all the statues shatter. Except one. A little stone rabbit is left, and he becomes the monster's only friend. He never says anything, but he doesn't disintegrate either. The monster is finally happy. He gradually becomes older, until in the end he is a wrinkled, white-furred creature who can barely hobble around. One day, the monster retreats into his cave and never comes out again. Grass and flowers return. Soon the blasted landscape is a beautiful garden. The rabbit is still where he was, though almost covered in vegetation. Occasionally people see him, and wonder: where did he come from?I loved this story. ",
            "This is the saddest freaking story I HAVE EVER READ. Hard to review, really. It's a beautiful story and the illustrations are wonderful, yes -- but seriously, kind of the LAST THING I want to read when I'm trying to put my four-year-old to bed. Add this one to the list of kids' books (like the Giving Tree and that awful book about the kid who loves his mother) that will leave you feeling melancholy for days after reading them.For the record, the 4-year-old liked the story (and was largely unmoved, emotionally) but more than anything, he was just fascinated by the fact that mommy was doing the ugly cry. Not cool.",
            "For adults (or even better, tortured teenagers), this might be a great book. I'm on the hated it side of the debate. Here's exactly what made me angry the first time I read it: But one day the monster never came out of his cave and the stone rabbit sat alone. My four-year-old daughter politely waited until I finished reading the story before asking me why the monster didn't come out of his cave anymore.Thanks a lot",
            "One of my favourite children books, years ago I saw a live performance of this with my daughter, was really well done.The book itself has some lovely illustrations, they are all full page and colourful. Possibly one of the saddest children's books I've ever read, the ending is incredibly moving. Really well written whilst dealing with some difficult subject matter.",
            "This story is an amazing read and has great illustrations to complement the message and storytelling. The Big Ugly Monster is the ugliest, scariest creature in the world but despite this, all he desires is friendship. All the animals run away from him, all the plants around him wither and die, and nothing ever goes the monster's way. That is until he creates a stone rabbit that makes no judgement upon him, does not shatter at his look or touch, and is content to spend all its time just being with the monster. The Monster is overjoyed and forever happy to have a companion who accepts him for himself and this happiness is reiterated time and time again in both the text and images throughout the book. The story does have its stronger note in that eventually the monster gets old and passes away. It is so well portrayed however, that you are left feeling both sad that the monster has gone and leaves the stone rabbit alone but also happy that the monster enjoyed his life and was happy. Furthermore the story emphasises remembrance and the importance of someone who is no longer with us and what they leave behind to remember them by.Teaching Point:This book is a very good resource to use in RE and PSHE discussions; it can be used to introduce a range of issues concerning mortality, friendship, remembrance and happiness. The book is left somewhat open ended and will require explanation to children in order for them to comprehend its meaning, however it is a beautiful resource to approach the subject of mortality and I would highly recommend it to for both KS1 and KS2 in tackling the aforementioned issues.",
            "The more I read the negative reviews here, the more I appreciate the book. Sure, read it yourself first, if your child is very young or very sensitive. But it's poignant, not maudlin or depressing. Remember, irl everyone will die. Probably lots of people that your child knows will die before he does. Deal with it. Help them learn skills to deal with it. (But if you're that vulnerable, whatever you do, don't pick up the masterpiece that is Michael Rosen's Sad Book.)",
            "This story is a metaphor, and it is wonderful. Ugly, horrible, foul things happen in the world; things so bad that they chase away everything that is beautiful. But one day - no matter how horrendous the evil - it will slowly slip from people's minds (mostly) and life will carry on ... though there will always be reminders hidden in the undergrowth for those that care to look ...",
            "Oh golly this book is so sad I had a cry and my toddler had to give me a hug to make me feel better! It is a good book where there is an opportunity to discuss many difficult topics including death which we have been talking about recently as my friend's gorgeous dog sadly passed away recently.",
            "My child picked this book out from the library today at school so I genuinely had no idea what the book would be about other than the fact it was about a monster. I see the message the author is trying to portray; being able to make yourself happy. But I think everything was done in poor taste. And that ending, I'm sitting here thinking huh? And once I closed The book I thought that this was one of the most depressing children's books I've ever read!!! "

        "description": "The Great Stone Face (The Old Man of the Mountains) juts out from the White Mountains of New Hampshire and looms over a small village. An old prophecy states that \"someone will be born hereabouts who will look just like the Great Stone Face, and he will be the noblest person of his time.\" Like many others, young Ernest watches the faces of returning famous men for signs of the gentle wisdom seen in the face. The rich merchant, however, is grasping, the soldier only stern, and the politician--well, a politician. Ernest, meanwhile, works hard on his farm and is looked up to by his neighbors for the thoughtful counsel he offers. As he grows old, people remark that they fear they will never see the prophecy fulfilled. At length, however, noticing Ernest's face, they discover that it was fulfilled long ago. This thoughtful look at what it means to live a good life is as relevant today as when first written. This collection also includes The Ambitious Guest, The Great Carbuncle, and Sketches from Memory.

            "As a boy, Ernest had wondered about the Stone Face that was formed by the rocks far up on the side of the mountain near his home. He often sat with his mother talking about the face. Once he asked if she thought they would ever see such a man with such a face and she shared what her mother had told her. Some day it was destined that a great one, who was noble and kind, would come and he would have that face. Ernest spent years studying the face each day looking up. He saw deep love in the face and he learned to recognize that in others. Ernest hoped to see the man who would come and he waited for him throughout his life. As he grew older many came and many brought some nobility even being felt by the people to be the one at first but never was the right one found. Often the people would shout saying, at last he has come, and what Ernest never understood is how they were so deceived and eventually the people would come to know they had been wrong. Near the end of Ernest's years a poet came and spoke to the people. Ernest stood and added his thoughts to the poets strong words. He spoke from his heart and mind and his words had power and depth, because they harmonized with the life he had always lived. The poet, seeing Ernest's face as he spoke,saw the grandeur it had assumed and shouted, Behold! Ernest is the likeness of the Great Stone Face.The people saw it was true and that the prophecy was fulfilled. Ernest was finished so he took the poet's arm and walked home",

Unless you are in the medical profession we are not really trained or prepared to provide end of life care. This book is a must read for family members and friends caring for loved ones at the end of life. It would also be beneficial for medical professionals to read as well. I found the book deeply moving and useful. It gave me insight into what my mother may be going through. As my mother suffers from Aphasia due to a stroke during her brain surgery she in not able to communicate her needs, feelings, fears with us. For this reason this book was recommended to me and for this reason I found it extremely helpful. Reading about what other people feel and think at end of life and what they found helpful has given me direction in my caregiving. Thank you David Kessler for the writing this book. ",
            "This is probably closer to a 3.5*. A broad and encompassing read that orients both the dying and their loved one\u2019s to the needs of the dying - mainly hope, beliefs, and final wishes.Although it\u2019s full of useful concepts, I found it almost to vague at times. The needs of the dying are deeply personal, but examples in this book almost rely on oneself to populate it with deeper meaning and emotion. Suggestions of how one might feel take the place of deeper discussion of how to process those emotions and work through them.",
            "For anyone who works with or supports people at end of life, this is a really good help! David Kessler has spent decades working with the dying and was a good friend and colleague of Elizabeth Kubler Ross. His experience, wisdom and teaching about supporting someone at end of life is invaluable. Some of this book is stories, some of it more practical, and both helpful. It also has a chapter on helping children through this sacred but often difficult times. "

            "Goodness, this was bad. I wouldnt have finished it if I hadnt been sitting in a waiting room with no other book on me. The story is so dry, the characters wooden, Rose and the Doctor hardly interact and when they do it's just so... boring. So really: the dialogue sucks, the world sucks, the species suck (they got different hands than humans? big fucking wow), the writing sucks. ",
            "Tennant was a bit more recognisable in this one, but the Doctor was still pretty generic in places.I guessed the secret behind the Witiku fairly early on, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment at all.",
            "Als mein erstes Doctor Who Buch wusste ich hier nicht so recht, was ich damit anfangen sollte.Irgendwie kannte man die Charaktere und irgendwie waren sie doch ein ganz kleines bisschen anders als sie sein sollten.Die Story an sich war zwar relativ spannend und irgendwo auch interessant, hat sich aber viel bei den Dr Who \u00fcblichen Erkl\u00e4rungen f\u00fcr alles und jeden, die \u00fcberhaupt keinen Sinn machen bedient. Die nicht-Doctor Charaktere hatten alle ein gro\u00dfes Schild auf der Stirn mit ich bin wichtig f\u00fcr die Story",
            "Was listening the audiobook. I almost love more to listen these stories then to read them. Nicely narrated.",
            "This was a good DW story, but I wasn't wowed by it. I thought The Doctor and Rose were written well and the world was good, but the ending was predictable. Still, on the whole, it was a fun read and I'm glad I read it. ",
            "So this was a good story, truly loved getting more inforamtion about the mystery piece by piece. That's all good.There is a lot that's wrong.The Doctor and Rose barely share forty pages together which yeah. I want The Doctor and his companion to bounce off each other in stories like with 10 and Donna later. But there is none of that here. Even the times they do spend together is ehhh.Loved the overall story. The monsters and how they are the way that they are. And the planet itself all worked wonderfully. Trully great stuff.I hate to say this but The Doctor felt really bland in this. Perhaps that's a bit to harsh. But last Doctor Who novel I read was The Blood Cell which was just so 12th Doctor it couldn't be anyone else.The Doctor could be swapped with any other incarnation without issue.Good but flawed.",
            "Like most DW books, it has an interesting concept that is eventually let down by a predictable ending--in the case of the Price of Paradise, the Doctor seems very slow to the chase--As a reader, you will work out the solution to most problems, and work out what's causing each problem, much earlier than the Doctor does which makes for a sometimes irritating read. On the other hand, the world is interesting and there is even a nice exploration element to it (Which I wish had been expanded on) The secondary characters are quite interesting, and I even worried about a few of them on occasion and the Doctor is just as fun to follow. Worth a read, but nothing extraordinary. ",
            "Just a rough review - may edit at a later date but I've got exams atm (2.5/5\u2606)I would just rate this as 'meh'.The storyline was an interesting one; it all started fitting together around 2/3rds of the way in. Although I'm still slightly confused what Professor Shulough's sketchy obsession with finding the trisilicate was but maybe I missed that part.Also a bit disappointed as Rose's character felt like it had no depth after reading the New Series Adventures with Martha. I adored Rez though! Why couldn't they make him a companion? :(Still reckon this is one of the best plots I've read of the NSAs so far though.",
            "Not sure if this book would be relevant to the current generation of Year 6 (who I would recommend it to), but if they're known for being big fans of sci-fi and have mentioned an interest in Doctor Who, this could be one for them. I read it as a young person and enjoyed it as it combines tribal culture (on another planet) with an ominous other-worldly threat that is a common trope with sci-fi. Might be worth a recommendation if they like sci-fi, want something fun to read and happen to be a whovian!",
            "This book was fine. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read but it was by no stretch of the imagination the best. Much of the plot was predictable and seemed stereotypical. Rose is my favorite companion, and I was disappointed by her portrayal in this book. That said, Ten is my favorite Doctor and he was characterized quite well. It was easy to picture David Tennant doing and saying what Colin Brake had written. ",
            "This book could have been so good if the author hadn't decided to describe the inhabitants of the planet Laylora by using an amalgamation of stereotypes about indigenous populations in the Americas as shorthand. As a story this book is really good, it's well paced, the characters have clear arcs and depth as warranted by their page time, we get into their heads in a rewarding way, I really want to like it, but I'm just very uncomfortable by the racial implications.",
            "42 WORD REVIEW:A competent SF story that captures the Tenth Doctor and Rose quite well. Through the Paradise Planet and her guardians, Blake works in a meaningful idea rather than the \u2018slapdash make a monster hash of it\u2019 approach of many other Who writers.",
            "Rose and the Doctor do not disappoint in this novel. The polluting of a paradise planet caused tremendous reactions. This was a quick read, great for Doctor Who reboot fans.Book #5 in my 2018 summer reading marathon. :-)",
            "It was okay - 3*This is completely different from my last read. I kind of liked it but I didn't love it. I wasn't blown away by the blurb and the story was just mediocre. There were lots of opportunity for growth that weren't exploited - that was disappointing.",
            "Enjoyed this one, but sadly nothing really stood out to me. I quite liked how Rose is written, but other than that I found it a bit hard to connect much with the new characters in this. All in all this was an entertaining read but not much more than that.",
            "Not bad, per se. A typical episode of Season 2, one of the more lackluster in the Doctor Who catalogue. This book isn't really here nor there, but where it falls down for me is the characterization of David Tennant. He's my favorite Doctor, and... this book doesn't do much for me. ",
            "The author definitely has a good sense of who the Doctor is; I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of how he wins over strangers and gets information out of them without them realizing it. Overall, a good fictional book for a little escapism. ",
            "Even this rating feels a tad dodgy to me but for reasons I can't fathom, I can't quite bring myself to give it 1 star...",
            "Honestly I've been listening to this as an audiobook for hours on end whilst painting. Practically heard it all in one go and it was quite fun. Not the best doctor who book I've read but okay.",
            "Listened to the audiobook. A good one-timer, but nothing special",

Houndsley is a wonderful cook but when he enters a cooking contest he gets nervous and doesn't have any fun. The friend realize they should do something because they enjoy and love it not because it will make them famous.I really like the message and story in this book. It feels like the book is actually saying something unlike many other early readers which just feel like words on a page. The watercolor illustrations are wonderfully cozy and while they are minimal they add just enough to the story to make it engaging. I love the attitude the illustrations add to Catina and Houndsley, they are so interesting!

            " On the Houndsley and Catina book jacket, author James Howe writes that his interest in creating this series stemmed in part from his daughter's fondness for the Frog and Toad books when she was young. I can certainly see a number of similarities between Houndsley and Catina and their famed amphibious counterparts, and I'm very happy that it was James Howe, one of the best authors I've ever read, who chose to take on this project. I'm completely confident that he can create a fantastic series of books featuring these characters, just as he did in Pinky and Rex, and I can hardly wait to read them. Catina is an ambitious young feline. She knows that it's fame and fortune she's gunning for in life, and attaining those goals is more important to her than the exact way that she ends up going about it. For now, she has focused her sights on writing, so she's fairly bursting with excitement when her friend Houndsley asks to read the book that she is in the process of creating. Little does he know that her story is a memoir, and a seventy-four chapter one, at that! As he reads the manuscript, Houndsley observes that Catina's thoughts are all over the place, and she seems to find it difficult to stick to one topic for long enough to say anything of substance. But how is he to tell her that she's not as good at writing as she wants to be, and her plan to ascend to stardom as the next Jean Fritz probably isn't going to work? After all, Houndsley is a very polite dog, and he has no desire to punch holes in his best friend's ambitions. Kind and soft-spoken, Houndsley is also a gifted cook, able to tailor the meals he makes to perfectly suit even the finicky Catina. Houndsley is content just to cook for his friends and make them happy, but Catina has other plans for her talented pal, and convinces Houndsley to enter a cooking contest that will air on television. Some people just aren't meant for the spotlight, though. When Houndsley isn't able to perform his best with the stage lights at their brightest, he takes it hard, and decides that there's no joy left for him in cooking. But there are still his friends to cook for, after all. What does it matter that the whole world doesn't know he's a fabulous artiste in the kitchen, as long as his friends appreciate his culinary masterpieces? There are still successes to be had even following a major failure. What James Howe expresses most effectively in this book, ultimately, is that so much of who Houndsley and Catina are as individuals is tied in with who they are to each other, and there's no reason to run away or hide from that. To be a friend in this world can be the most rewarding experience imaginable, even if no one else can understand the strength of the bond or comprehend why a particular set of two people chose each other. The sweetness of life lived together can be keenly felt on one special summer night as Houndsley and Catina watch the fireflies floating around the yard beneath the quiet, star-studded sky. The two friends know that they will still be friends tomorrow, and the next day, and for as long after that as can be. Sometimes, what we already have is even nicer than what we really, really want.  I would give two and a half stars to Houndsley and Catina. James Howe is good at bringing honest emotion to even the shortest of stories, and this book is an excellent example of that. Readers of any age will enjoy Houndsley and Catina, so I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I believe that the series may be a classic in the making. ",

            "This was okay. I really liked the illustrations, but the story was kind of meh. I loved the dog's character, but I felt like the cat was so full of herself. I didn't like how the cat kept talking about herself and basically ignoring the dog at the beginning of the story. If the story flowed better I would have liked it a lot more, especially since this is the first book of Houndsley and Catina. I don't really want to read more after this one.

The book is a collection of three stories, similar in style and format in Arnold Lobel\u2019s Frog and Toad Series. Houndsley, the dog, and Catina, the cat, help each other as the struggle to become famous. Catina wants to be a writer, but does not like to write, and Houndsley loves to cook for fun, but not to be the best. The pair\u2019s friendship is easy for children to relate to, and the story is easy to read and builds confidence in reading. Personal Reaction: I like this book because the illustrations are fun and the stories are applicable to real-life and humorous, which children enjoy. Additionally, the book can help to teach children what is socially acceptable and how they show, interact appropriately with their peers.",

        "description": "Through a long and chequered career, Mick Farren has functioned as a writer, poet, rock star, recording artist, rabble-rouser, critic and commentator, and even won a protracted obscenity trial at the Old Bailey. After resisting the idea for a long time, he has finally written his own highly personal and insightful account of the British counterculture in the 1960s and '70s, from the perspective of one who was right there in the thick of it. With a continuing and unashamed commitment to the tradition of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, he recounts a rollercoaster odyssey - sometimes violent and often hilarious - from early beatnik adventures in Ladbroke Grove, through the flowering hippies to the snarl of punk. He gives a firsthand, insider's account of the chaos, disorder and raging excess of those two highly excessive decades. At the centre of the book is Farren's career in the underground, as the man on the door at the UFO club, driving spirit at IT and, of course, lead singer with the Social Deviants. He describes his encounters with the celebrated and the notorious, who range from Jimi Hendrix and Germaine Greer to Julie Burchill and Sid Vicious, and concludes that the pop history of bohemian culture does not neatly divide itself into easy decades, but continues to this day, perhaps in different guises, but frequently with the same goals and motivations.",

            "Note Mick FarrenFarren was the singer with the proto-punk English band The Deviants between 1967 and 1969, releasing three albums. In 1970 he released the solo album Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus which also featured Steve Peregrin Took, John Gustafson and Paul Buckmaster, before leaving the music business to concentrate on his writing.In the mid-1970s, he briefly returned to music releasing the EP Screwed Up, album Vampires Stole My Lunch Money and single Broken Statue. The album featured fellow NME journalist Chrissie Hynde and Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson.He has sporadically returned to music",
            "Mick thinks a lot of himself! Sure there are moments of self-criticism, but overall this is a man who - although he admittedly left his mark on the late 60's/early 70's underground - has a rather inflated opinion of his own importance. It's an entertaining read but it does dip about halfway through and I started to think that Farren was starting to sound like the loud, drunken guest who entertains as he takes centre stage at the party but who, after a while, you just wish would shut up. Give The Anarchist A Cigarette does raise its game again towards the end when we reach the NME/punk period of his life, though we still had the big, bravado Mick saying things like The major resentment I had towards punk was that it was bloody easy when everyone was doing it. Ten years earlier I'd been on my own",

Hanging out with Jim Morrison through to Mick Jagger and beyond the tales of his own band the Social Deviants (Later the Deviants) are often very funny including his claim to be the earliest London band to cover the Velvet Underground in '67 before the records were out even!This is a full on drugs and sex and rock and roll story that connected a lot of dots for me, well worth reading and it makes me want to read more of his work and to find some of his records, anyone know which ones are worth getting?",

The book is as disjointed and erratic as you imagine someone should be who's consumed the amount of drugs and alcohol that Mr. Farren has. As someone who grew up in the sixties and is a fan of many of the groups of that era, I found this a compulsive read and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I would recommend you read a chapter before you buy it because it's not a book for the faint- hearted",
            "Mick Farren was one of my heroes and this book explains why. The guy was a true original and a brilliant writer, to boot."

        "description": "For the Hmong people living in overcrowded refugee camps in Thailand, America is a dream: the land of peace and plenty. In 1995, ten years after their arrival at the camp, thirteen-year-old Mai Yang and her grandmother are about to experience that dream. In America, they will be reunited with their only remaining relatives, Mai\u2019s uncle and his family. They will discover the privileges of their new life: medical care, abundant food, and an apartment all their own. But Mai will also feel the pressures of life as a teenager. Her cousins, now known as Heather and Lisa, try to help Mai look less like a refugee, but following them means disobeying Grandma and Uncle. From showers and smoke alarms to shopping, dating, and her family\u2019s new religion, Mai finds life in America complicated and confusing. Ultimately, she will have to reconcile the old ways with the new, and decide for herself the kind of woman she wants to be. This archetypal immigrant story introduces readers to the fascinating Hmong culture and offers a unique outsider\u2019s perspective on our own.",

            "Technically this book was in the children's room, not the YA room, but I'd still call it a YA book for my own purposes. I'm marking this review for spoilers, even though I don't give away any major plot points, because I do go into detail about a particular set of scenes.I once read a book when I was 13 or so about a southeast Asian refugee girl (I can't remember any more about it) and have met many Cambodians & Laotians since then, and so this book really grabbed my attention. I started reading this, and it was dark, dark, dark. Not super-graphic, I think an 11 year old could (and should) read this book, but still very sad. Maybe sadder for me as an adult, who has an idea of the trajectory of many first generation immigrants, than it would be for me as an 11 or 12 year old. The main character, Mai, is very believable, both as a young girl and as a refugee. I was particularly impressed at how the author managed to convey the sense of how alien America was to Mai, and how the young are able to adapt. The story of Mai's grandmother, while very sad, was not surprising either.I'm torn about this book - it ends on a high note, which I think is kind of important for both an immigrant story aimed at kids & as an ending to Mai's book. Without the hope at the end, the rest of the book would be just too bleak. I would definitely recommend this book to people who live in culturally diverse areas, and people who DON'T live in culturally diverse areas. I would recommend this for kids - but with the caveat that their parents read it first. I think there are some themes in here, specifically rape that occurs in the refugee camps, that would require careful parental discussion, depending on the kid. I think that there are some kids who would read those parts and never really understand what happened to the girls, and that there are some kids who would latch on to the mindset of the Hmong that is described - that the rape victims are dirtied by the attack, even though the blame is not directly laid on the girls by the author or even explicitly by other Hmong characters in the book. I think that's my biggest caveat to the book. I don't think that those parts should have been left out, I think glossing them over would have done a big disservice to both the smaller picture and larger picture of the Hmong refugee story, but it is a plot point that needs to be handled with care. The author Pegi Dietz Shea did an excellent job in writing those scenes, balancing the matter-of-fact tone of an event that is regretfully common with the quiet shame and fear of the victims. I know I'm harping on this section, but I worry that this is something that would make a lot of people not want their kids to read this book, and I think that this book has a lot to offer.",
            "This was a fascinating read. The story of a Hmong girl (a mountain tribe that had many men help the Americans during the Vietnamese war) who comes from a refugee camp in Thailand to Providence RI, and tries to assimilate to a vastly different culture. Her voice was strong, and details of her traditional life were fascinating. Many contrast are provided, with her grandmother resistant to new ways, her Americanized cousins fighting old ways, and her uncle embracing some of the new while holding on to some traditions. Very nicely written, and I especially enjoyed the references to Providence, where I live. I worked with some Hmong children at Roger Williams middle school back in the 80's. A storyteller and I had then write and illustrate family stories, and many of them heard for the first time how their family's had escaped Laos and made it to America. ",
            "Good book. Interesting story, but I would LOVE for there to be a sequel so that I could learn how Heather's, Lisa's and Mai's lives turned out. The story just seemed incomplete at the end.",
            "Oh my gosh I loved this book. LOVED IT!!!!!!! I cried too. but it was an AMAZING book.",
            "Please read if you are wondering if your kids should read it!I really did like this book, but I was a bit shocked when I first started reading it, as it was mistakenly place in the children's section of the library I work at. After reading it, it was promptly put in the young adult section. For those of you wondering if it is appropriate for your children to read, I say it is up to you, but you should definitely read it first to decide for yourself. I do not presently have kids, but if I did, I would not let them read it until at least late middle school if not older. We would also be having a discussion on all of it afterwards. Read on if you would like to know why I have that take on it.Spoilers in the next paragraph.I would say this book is really for older readers. In the beginning, it has references to rape and brutality. It later has an attempted rape that just barely gets stopped before any penetration takes place. It speaks about one character being in a gang and using drugs. Frequently throughout the book it has teens smoking and talk of marrying off the children while still underage as well as teen pregnancy. By the end of the book, the 16 year old girl has run away with her boyfriend and the other girl, who if I remember correctly is 15, has been married off by her parents to a 15/16 year old boy and quickly gets pregnant, which the main characters are all very excited about.Spoilers over.Once again, I won't tell you how to parent your children but I would really recommend you reading it before your kids do. It is a good book and the things in it definitely need to be talked about and recognized, but it might be pretty intense for some readers. I had to stop reading at times and take a few minutes before I could get back to it. There are also moments that I believe might be beneficial if there was a content or trigger warning at the beginning of the book, but I'm not sure how others feel about that.All in all, take my review for what you will, but those are my thoughts. I hope that they are helpful for some of you!",
            "First time I had ever heard of the Hmong refugees when this book crossed my desk. Naturally, I had to read it to learn more. Harrowing and amazing story. Refugees have my total sympathy. It must have been a great cultural shock to be moved to the U.S. from a third world refugee camp. I have met many refugees through my work. The Somalians I met were experiencing the same this back in the late 90's, early 2000's. Sad. I am so glad to hear that the Hmong are doing well over here these days. They adapted very well.",
            "Mai and her grandmother are in a refugee camp in Thailand. May dreams of coming to America where her Aunt, Uncle and cousins live. Once in America, everything is different. Mai is curious to learn everything while her grandmother is content to rely on Mai for everything. This is a heartwarming story that tugs at your heartstrings.",
            "this book in my opinion tells us about the difference from where you live and where you are, and that new things can be scary meanwhile old things can be forgotten easily. But the tradition lives on even if you are now in the new.",

            "Tangled threads by: Pegi Deitz Shea is a story about change, feelings and the horrors of the Vietnam war.Mai Yang has lived in a crowded refugee camp in Thailand for as long as she can remember. She lived in a tiny hut with her grandmother, avoiding soldiers, stitching story cloths, and waiting for the day they can leave for America. Finally they get the word that they can leave for providence to be with her uncle and cousins who had already left. Mai can't wait to do and have all the luxuries her cousins, see and pa cua have described in their letters. But then she discovers all the hard things they have to do before leaving. See and pa cua have become teens who changed their names to heather and Lisa and tease Mai about not knowing all these things in America. It seems as if everything she does is different than in Thailand and she has to figure them out on her own. In the camp she always relied on her grandma. But now her grandma relies on her to teach her everything. After heather and Lisa share a mind blowing secret with her she becomes more selfish towards her grandma that she never had felt before. Her new family is being shattered when she thought that it would be perfect after they came to America. Still drawn to her old Hmong life but also her new life in America, mai has to fit them together so everyone can be happy including herself.This book fits in the genre of non fiction because it is the true story of Mai and her grandma going through the cruelty happening in their camp which is close to the city of ban vinai, Thailand. I really liked this book. It's a good book for people who like the tension of waiting to see what will happen next. My favorite part of the book is when Mai and her grandmother are trying the new foods and they don't know how to eat them the right way. Sometimes I got the feeling that I was Mai like when she got angry with her grandmother I knew what she feeling like. I couldn't stop reading it, it was so good. I found some contradictions to the characters like when Mai got angry with her grandmother for the first time and when heather and Lisa got kind of mean. I really like this book and I think you would too if you like reading about change, standing up for yourself and even funny moments.",
            "OK...one of the main reasons that I picked this up was because when Mai comes to America, she settles in Providence, RI. Since I grew up in Providence and had some Hmong friends, I figured it would be cool to read this. This book pulls no punches when it describes Mai and her life in the refugee camp. I think this is so valuable for students to read this and realize how blessed and lucky we are in the United States. But, being from Providence, I also pick up on the glaring inaccuracies. Like Mai's visit to the 2-level Emerald Square Mall (actually 3 levels) and the fountain in the middle (nope, not that this mall). I will of course keep reading, but hopefully there aren't many more mistakes like this.Despite the small errors in describing locations, I think this is worth 4 stars. The cover almost makes it seem like it would be for younger readers. Before reading it, I would have assumed that it was more for middle school. However, after reading, I would definitely keep it at the high school level. It's not a difficult or hard read, but there is a lot of content including war, rape, drug use, teen marriage, polygamy, teen pregnancy, etc., that may be slightly more appropriate for older readers. Younger readers can still read this book and gain value from reading it, but it might help to discuss context, content and maybe pair it with other immigration stories. ",
            "Tangled Threads: A Hmong Girl's Story by Pegi Deitz Shea is a juvenile novel that follows thirteen-year old Mai from the Thai refugee camp where she lived for ten years, to Providence, Rhode Island where she and her grandmother join her uncle and cousins who emigrated five years earlier. The novel depicts the joy and pitfalls and confusion of the immigrant experience. Mai is excited to leave the refugee camp, but her grandmother is reluctant about starting a new life in a foreign land where the Hmong traditions are difficult to keep intact. The thing that binds Mai and her grandmother in this new life is pa'ndau, traditional Hmung story cloths. Mai and her grandmother made these for sale in the refugee camps and continue to make them in America. Worked in reverse appliqu\u00e9, cross stitch and surface embroidery techniques, these colorful cloths tell the story of their lives, including the death of Mai's parent's in a Laos bombing, and are used to make traditional clothing. The symbols on the cloth harken good luck and fortune and tie Mai to her past as she makes a new life in Rhode Island. Tangled Threads is a poignant story that will help children and adults better empathize with immigrants in their schools and community. Well worth reading. ",
            "This is a story of 13 year old Mai Yang who along with her grandmother finally comes to America after spending 10 years living In a tiny hut in a refugee camp in Thailand. As the story is told of the difficulties Mai Yang and her grandmother have trying to assimilate into American life, the story of Mai yang's younger years is revealed.The fear of yellow rain during the war, the loss of her patents, the possibility of assault and the years of learning English ways. Mai Yang met up with some evil people yet also some kind hearted caring people. This book awakened me to what these refugees went through before coming here. I never really thought about the length of time spent in the refugee camps.It was also interesting to learn about the conflicts between the younger and older generations of Hmong when coming to the US. The young seem to learn the language so much faster and they are not as fearful. Therefore they almost reverse the cultural roles. I also learned a lot about the culture of these beautiful people. I really enjoyed this book. Mai Yang wanted so to be a good girl, get a good education and stay away from gangs.",
            "Mai is a twelve-year-old Hmong girl who has lived almost her entire life in a refugee camp in Thailand. She and her Grandma have been waiting five years to join their only remaining family in Providence, Rhode Island, and the time has finally come. When they arrive in the US, however, life is harder than Mai expects. She is surprised to learn that the cousins she remembers rarely practice any of the Hmong traditions, and her aunt and uncle have converted to Christianity but still hold onto many Hmong ideas, such as marrying their daughters off at a very young age. Meanwhile, Grandma becomes depressed in this new place that she doesn't understand, and Mai is forced to take care of her at every turn.Tangled Threads tells the story of Mai's first year in the US, as she adapts to American culture while trying retaining some of the customs that are all that remain of her former life. The book is well written, and Mai's voice is strong. Readers unfamiliar with Hmong culture will learn a great deal from the story.",
            "Well, the summary was very interesting, which was the main reason I picked up this book. Sadly, enough, I didn\u2019t find it to be very outstanding, as the summary might\u2019ve suggested.It was another first-person book that I couldn\u2019t quite connect to the main character with. Then again, I haven\u2019t really experienced the same things that Mai has. Even so, I was incredibly unimpressed with the story as a whole.The Grandmother\u2019s death was\u2026 strange. I understand that everyone deals with death and grieves differently, but the writing didn\u2019t really leave enough room for the reader to feel as though they should be sad. In fact, to me, I felt as though it was just another event that happened in the book, just a way to\u2026 bring it to a swift end. And the end itself leaves room for more. Much more.I liked the book \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 but I have mixed feelings toward it. It\u2019s not something I would reread any time soon, let\u2019s put it that way.",
            "*SPOILERS* Mai Yang and her grandmother have been living in a Thailand refugee camp for 10 years. Mai longs to be in America with her cousins and aunt and uncle. Finally word comes that Mai and her grandmother can join their family in Rhode Island. Their new life requires much adjustment from how to use appliances to how to act at school. Mai's cousins aren't as she remembered; they have American names now, lie, and talk back to their parents and hang out with their boyfriends on the sly. Mai wants to spend time with her cousins but is uncomfortable with their behavior. Grandmother fares worst of all, never leaving the apartment to meet other Hmong but spending time sewing her pa'ndau in front of the TV. But then Mai learns that she and grandmother could have left for America at the same time as her relatives. When Grandmother is dying of a heart attack she reveals the fear she had of leaving Laos, that she wouldn't have anything in America.",
            "Some of my fourth graders had begun to read this book, but stopped reading it because they said it was too hard. I thought it looked interesting, and being an ESL teacher, I wanted to see what it was like because the title drew me in. I liked this book a lot. I read it over the weekend. I found it pretty believable and not overwhelmingly sad. The main character, Mai, seems like she could be a real person. The experiences she had are pretty typical of Hmong refugee girls around the late 80s-early 90s, possibly even later, too. If I were younger, I think I probably would not have understood many of the references. As one other reviewer stated, it is best if a parent reads it first and then the child. I think it would be best for children who are about 12 and older, though, not 10 like my fourth graders, both because of the mature themes and the reading level.",
            "Mai and her grandmother are living in a refugee camp in Thailand. Some of their Hmong family are already in the United States and Mai dreams of joining them. Things finally work out so that she and Grandma can go to Providence, Rhode Island and live with her cousins. I love how Mai describes all the new things she encounters, things that we definitely use without a second thought (appliances, school lunch, smoke alarms, bus rides, etc). And the author does a wonderful job of weaving the Hmong tradition into the American ones. This was a great read.",
            "This is an impressive and well-written book about a Hmong girl's search for identity in a new culture. The author has done her homework and it shows. Mai's struggle to integrate her Hmong traditions into her new life in Providence, RI, is realistically yet sensitively handled. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the immigrant experiance, or in how our own culture might be seen through an immigrant 's eyes.",
            "Mai has had to overcome many obstacles in her young life and flawlessly discusses them in her first-person narrative. Living in a refugee camp with her grandmother, their eventual move to America only begins a new set of struggles: to assimilate. Her biggest lessons lie in the ability to continue to learn American ways, but also keeping true to her strong Hmong roots.",
            "An interesting book about a thirteen year old Hmong refugee and what she went through both in the camps and in trying to fit in and understand American society. Describes relationships with her cousins and Grandma well, but I found this on the children's lit shelves. Due to some content about rape, though not graphic, I would have to label it YA instead. Good read for twelve and up. ",
            "Mai and her grandmother have lived for 10 years in a Thai refugee camp. Her parents were killed in Laos during the war. Grandma decides they should finally go to America where her only survuvung son moved to years before. This story covers her struggles to keep her hmong culture & way as well as gain new American ones. ",
            "There is a large Hmong population where I live, so the title caught my eye, as I realized that for all that, I knew next to nothing about Hmong culture or ancestry by the time I graduated. This not only provided some background, but offered an eye-opening contrast between the newly-immigrated and the culturally-assimilated.",
            "Bits of history I lived through but was not familiar with are woven seamlessly into this tenderly moving middle grade novel that chronicles the difficult transition of one Hmong girl from refugee camp in Thailand to Providence, RI. ",
            "Realistic fiction about a young Hmong girl who leaves the refugee camp in Laos with her grandma, to join the rest of her family in Providence. Great book discussion book--many coming of age issues that transcend culture. ",
            "This book wasn't bad or anything. It was a pretty good actually, but it wasn't amazing or anything. It was kind of obvious, but the grandmother part was quite sad. I don't think the main character appreciated her grandmother's sacrifices. ",
            "Last book of 2012! It was ok. I learned about the Hmong people. Also, I got see what it's like for a refugee to adapt in their final destination. However, for 2013 I want to read less of these types of books (YA), unless they are classics."
