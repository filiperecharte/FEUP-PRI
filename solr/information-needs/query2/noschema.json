          "description":["Lyric and sensual, D.H. Lawrence's last novel is one of the major works of fiction of the twentieth century. Filled with scenes of intimate beauty, explores the emotions of a lonely woman trapped in a sterile marriage and her growing love for the robust gamekeeper of her husband's estate. The most controversial of Lawrence's books, \"Lady Chatterly's Lover\" joyously affirms the author's vision of individual regeneration through sexual love. The book's power, complexity, and psychological intricacy make this a completely original work--a triumph of passion, an erotic celebration of life.\"Nobody concerned with the novel in our century can afford not to read it.\" -- Lawrence Durrell"],

            "Lady Chatterley's Lover, David Herbert Richards = (D.H.) LawrenceLady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence, first published privately in 1928 in Italy, and in 1929 in France and Australia. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960.The story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper class husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, has been paralysed from the waist down due to a Great War injury. In addition to Clifford's physical limitations, his emotional neglect of Constance forces distance between the couple. Her emotional frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class. The novel is about Constance's realization that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «فاسق خانم چترلی»؛ «فاسق لیدی چترلی»؛ «عاشق خانم چترلی»؛ «عاشق بانو چترلی»؛ «معشوق لیدی چترلی»؛ نویسنده: دیوید هربرت (دی.اچ.) لارنس؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز سی و یکم ماه ژانویه سال1972میلادیعنوان: معشوق لیدی چترلی؛ دیویدهر��رت لارنس؛ مترجمها ناهید و افسانه قادری؛ تهران، نشر متیس، سال1398؛ در570ص؛ شابک9786008928447؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده20مرمان «عاشق لیدی چترلی»، اثری از «دی.اچ لارنس» است، که چاپ نخستینش به سال1928میلادی برمی‌گردد؛ نسخه ی نخست رمان، به طور پنهانی و زیرزمینی، با یاری «جوزپه اوریولی»، در «فلورانس ایتالیا» به چاپ رسید؛ هم‌چنین در سال1929میلادی، نسخه‌ ای دیگر از این رمان باز هم پنهانی توسط نشر «ماندارکِ اینکی استفنسن»؛ در دسترس خوانشگران قرار گرفت؛ انتشار نسخه ی کامل و بدون سانسور این رمان، تا سال1960میلادی در «ایالات متحدهٔ آمریکا» و «بریتانیا» قدغن بود؛ عاشق «لیدی چترلی» که یک اثر کلاسیک است، بسیار زود به دلیل محتوای داستان، که بیان روابط جسمی میان مردی از طبقه کارگر، و زنی از رده های بالا و مرفه است، توصیف صریح و بی‌پردهٔ صحنه‌ های جنسی، و استفاده از واژگان قبیح و مبتذل، به شهرتی جنجال‌ برانگیز رسید؛ گفته می‌شود داستان برگرفته از رخ‌دادهای زندگی شخصی «لارنس» است، و مضامین کتاب را ایشان از زادگاهشان «ایستوود ناتینگهام‌ شایرر» الهام گرفته‌ اند؛ برخی از منتقدان بر این باورند، که الهام‌بخش «لارنس» برای آفرینش قهرمان رمان «لیدی چترلی»، «لیدی اوتولاین مرل» بوده‌ اند؛ عاشق «لیدی چترلی» که در سه نسخه ی گوناگون چاپ شده‌ است، آخرین و مشهورترین رمان «لارنس» است؛داستان «عاشق لیدی چترلی» روایت زندگی زنی جوان، و متأهل به نام «کنستانس (لیدی چترلی)» است، که همسر اشراف‌زاده‌ اش «کلیفورد چترلی»، در اثر جنگ، قطع نخاع می‌شود؛ ناتوانی جنسی، و سردی احساس «کلیفورد» نسبت به «کنستانس (کانی)»، دیوار فاصله میان این زوج را بالا می‌برد؛ «کانی» که امیال جنسی اش را سرکوب شده می‌بیند، دلباختهٔ شکاربان شوهرش «الیور ملورز»، که مردی از طبقات پایین است، می‌شود؛ در انتهای رمان، «کنستانس» همسرش را ترک می‌کند، تا روابط عاشقانه ی تازه ای را با «ملورز» از سر گیرد؛ تفاوت سطح اجتماعی میان «کنستانس» و «ملورز»، که بن‌مایه ی اصلی رمان است، در واقع نمود سلطه ی نابرابر طبقه ی نخبه و بالادست، بر طبقه ی کارگر در جامعه را بازگو میکندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 03/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",
            "Oh man, I wanted to like this soooo bad! So many people complained about it, but I misconstrued their complaints for prudishness or lord knows what. (NOTE TO SELF: Stop judging people's judgements until you can judge for yourself!)But the fact is, two-thirds of the way in I was done with this. I absolutely trudged through to the end. Why? It's not because this is basically porn. I luuuuvs me the sex! Apparently this caused quite a scandal and I can see why. The language is sexually explicit, unnecessarily so...or well, maybe not. I suppose it needed to be said at the time or at least some time. However, a person can only take so many fucks before they no longer give one.And I wasn't turned off by the lengthy asides Lawrence takes while grinding his ax against the industrialization of England's Midlands. Like Melville's treatise on whales in the midst of his adventure novel, Lawrence had an agenda in writing Lady Chatterley's Lover and he often takes the reader out of the main story in order to linger upon his pet project. That can be distracting, but in this case it's not enough to make me hate the thing, not on the whole.No, my main issue is with the writing, which is a big problem since there's so much of it in books. Lawrence is quite a capable writer, but he does get adverb-lazy now and then, and often repeats words for emphasis. That last point can be effective, say when trying to instill a sense of forward motion when describing something that's going faster and faster. Occasionally the technique works for him. Usually it does not work for me. Some call it a poetic style. I call it bullshit...what do I mean? Well, allow me to Lawrence-ify it: The technique is bullshit in the most bullshitty sense, by which I mean, it is bullshit. As you see, it looks like I've explained myself, yet I've said nothing. Done with flair, it can sound lyrical, even powerful. To me, it sounds like so much hot air. And what does hot air sound like? It sounds like",
            "Ah, D.H. Lawrence, why are you so awesome?I think Lawrence is one of those writers you either love or hate, and this is possibly even more true of Lady Chatterley's Lover, his last novel. The author's confidence speaks on every page: firstly, Lawrence has no qualms about interjecting his opinion in the narration throughout. Secondly, the book is from the perspective of a woman, a challenge for any male author, and thirdly (and possibly most famously), the book makes liberal use of fuck and cunt. It's not just that the book is about sexual awakening",

Carter's acute observations are spiked with her pungent honesty, her devastating wit, her penchant for mockery, and her passion for the absurd. Whether discussing films or food, feminism or fantasy, science fiction or sex, Carter consistently explores new territories and overturns old ideas. From her hilarious deconstruction of \"Gone With the Wind\" and a delightfully wicked description of a Japanese fertility festival to enchanting accounts of her early childhood adventures or the irreverent reevaluations of D. H. Lawrence, H. P. Lovecraft, and Elizabeth David, this marvelous companion to \"Burning Your Boats,\" which collected Carter's short fiction, firmly places her among the most accomplished writers of this century.

          "reviews":["‘Books about books is fun but frivolous,’ Angela Carter once said to an interviewer – which just goes to show that she, unlike most, was capable of proving herself wrong. This collection of her reviews, essays, articles and general criticism is definitely fun but far from frivolous – on the contrary, having it all here in one brick-sized articulation gives it the contours of quite a serious cumulative argument, one focused on the intersection of eroticism, feminism, intellectual frustration and dry wit. And it's useful to have it. I always liked the baroque, oneiric oddness of her fiction, but I never quite understood what argument or philosophy was motivating it. Now, I feel like I do.Carter was born in 1940, the year after Germaine Greer and Margaret Atwood, and one way to think about her is to recognise that she, like them, grew up imbibing and driving and reshaping the same intellectual currents of second-wave feminism and power politics. (If only she, like them, had also lived long enough to make bloody-minded comments on the latest iterations of the gender debates.) Feminism is, for her, not so much a political position as an inherent facet of her common sense, and when you read Angela Carter on gender issues (which is an utter joy), you never feel that she's writing to work out some animus against anyone.Rarely, in other words, is she interested in facile attributions of blame. Instead, her basic position is one of bemused frustration, which she makes seem incredibly productive. Surveying the profusion of women's magazines, for instance, she examines the photo-strips and romance tips confusedly, before concluding:It is as if marriage functions as the sexuality of women. It occupies the imagination of these magazines to the same obsessive extent that sexuality itself does in the tit mags. Perhaps, like the tit mags, these magazines do not truly reflect the central preoccupations of the readers.This is a theme she develops in several pieces – nowhere more thrillingly than in a virtuoso essay called ‘Alison's Giggle’ which she wrote in 1983 for a book called The Left and the Erotic. The essay's title comes from an incident in The Miller's Tale where, if you remember, a cheating wife sticks her bottom out of the window and contrives for her cuckolded husband, who is confused by the darkness, to kiss her arse. This makes Alison the wife giggle – as Chaucer tells us (‘Tehee! quod she’).Carter takes this bawdy heroine as a foundational example in English literature of ‘the assumption that men and women share an equal knowledge of the basic facts of sexual experience’, an assumption that lasts ‘up until, curiously enough, that very time in the eighteenth century when women in significant numbers take up their pens and write’. It's a thesis she follows through Austen, Eliot, Colette, and up to Doris Lessing and Jean Rhys, full of fascinating detours and pointed conclusions on how women are treated in literature.But at least Alison managed to get herself fucked by the man of her choice, to her own satisfaction and with no loss of either her own self-respect or the respect of her male creator, which is more than a girl like her will be able to do again, in fiction, for almost more than half a millennium.Though fair-minded and full of humour, she is especially fun to read when she does take exception to something. She opens a review of Arthur Marwick's Beauty in History by noting drily that the authorcertainly knows what he likes and a fitting subtitle for Beauty in History might be: ‘Women I have fancied throughout the ages with additional notes on some of the men I think I might have fancied if I were a woman’.Carter pauses to ponder, uncensoriously, ‘the way in which appearance functions as a kind of visible sexuality for women’; then, with that hanging in the air, she turns her attention back to Marwick's approach. Ruthlessly unpicking the prurience underlying his book, and quoting him to devastating effect (‘Twiggy, with her 31-inch bust, had beautiful, small but perfectly proportioned breasts, as can be seen from the photograph of her in a bikini reproduced III, 116’), Carter summons up a sort of dismissive indulgence which is more withering than any denunciation:There is something almost – but, again, not quite – touching about the boyish enthusiasm Professor Marwick evinces towards his subject. There are whole pages off which one can feel the acne rise.Christ! One pictures Professor Marwick limping towards the nearest burns centre…. In real life (she says, in the introduction to Expletives Deleted), she is ‘notoriously foul-mouthed’, and spent a lot of time when writing reviews struggling to translate her initial reactions (‘bloody awful’, ‘fucking dire’) into more high-minded language. The results are impressive.Of course, it helps that the range of her interests is so broad – in here is everything from travelogues of Japanese fertility festivals, through reviews of Bertolucci, to a Bob Dylan gig in 1966 (‘thin and black-clad and linear, a Beardsley hobgoblin’), from thoughts on fashion and cooking, all the way to explorations of fanzines and an investigation into the ethics of HP Lovecraft's horror stories (in which ‘Evil is…it is not what men do’).She was a powerhouse, and this collection – huge but still not complete – makes you miss her voice more than ever. No one has really replaced her, and indeed, reading through Shaking a Leg, you wonder how anyone could.",
            "Angela Carter thinks everything looks like a penis. Or a vagina, or maybe, occasionally, a tit. Partly this is because she seems to spend half her time traveling to Japanese penis festivals, but mostly it's because, you know, she's one of those feminists who think everything looks like a penis.At my right-on university, you were expected to agree with her about everything, but not, bizarrely, to have actually read anything she wrote. It was presented as dogma, rather than thought, which is a shame since she turns out to be far more open-minded and witty than her acolytes.I saw someone else had described this book in a one-word review as sharp",
            "What started as secondary material for my thesis became a source of infinite inspiration. Carter has such a bright, associative mind - don't be distracted by the titles of her pieces. Every piece is worth reading. Every piece has something of value. ",
            "Very good essays mainly written in the 1960s-1980s. Angela Carter presents a clear picture of life in Britain during those times. If you enjoy reading essays that are both wry and humorous I think you’ll have fun reading this book.",
            "Angela Carter on evil in the works of H.P. Lovecraft:Evil is. . . It is not what men do. Evil is an abstraction",
            "Carter's essay are entertaining and thought provoking. Also, very often funny. In this collection, there are book reviews, travelogues, and political commentary. My favorite essay is the comparison/contrast essay about Paddington and Winne the Pooh."],

          "description":["A modern master of the historical novel, Jeff Shaara has painted brilliant depictions of the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, and World War I. Now he embarks upon his most ambitious epic, a trilogy about the military conflict that defined the twentieth century. The Rising Tide begins a staggering work of fiction bound to be a new generation’s most poignant chronicle of World War II. With you-are-there immediacy, painstaking historical detail, and all-inclusive points of view, Shaara portrays the momentous and increasingly dramatic events that pulled America into the vortex of this monumental conflict.As Hitler conquers Poland, Norway, France, and most of Western Europe, England struggles to hold the line. When Germany’s ally Japan launches a stunning attack on Pearl Harbor, America is drawn into the war, fighting to hold back the Japanese conquest of the Pacific, while standing side-by-side with their British ally, the last hope for turning the tide of the war.Through unforgettable battle scenes in the unforgiving deserts of North Africa and the rugged countryside of Sicily, Shaara tells this story through the voices of this conflict’s most heroic figures, some familiar, some unknown. As British and American forces strike into the “soft underbelly” of Hitler’s Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper. As battles rage along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the momentum of the war begins to shift, setting the stage for the massive invasion of France, at a seaside resort called Normandy.More than an unprecedented and intimate portrait of those who waged this astonishing global war, The Rising Tide is a vivid gallery of characters both immortal and unknown: the as-yet obscure administrator Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose tireless efficiency helped win the war; his subordinates, clashing in both style and personality, from George Patton and Mark Clark to Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery. In the desolate hills and deserts, the Allies confront Erwin Rommel, the battlefield genius known as “the Desert Fox,” a wounded beast who hands the Americans their first humiliating defeat in the European theater of the war. From tank driver to paratrooper to the men who gave the commands, Shaara’s stirring portrayals bring the heroic and the tragic to life in brilliant detail. A new level of accomplishment from this already acclaimed author, The Rising Tide will leave readers eager for the next volume of this superb saga of the war that saved and changed the world."],

          "reviews":["“Victory comes from the strategy, the plan, the tools we are given.”“The Rising Tide” is the first of four books historical novelist Jeff Shaara wrote about WW II. It was better than I expected it to be. This novel follows the North African and Sicilian campaigns of the war, a part of WW II I know little about, despite the fact that BOTH of my grandfathers served in those campaigns. Shaara does an excellent job demonstrating in this novel how pivotal those campaigns were to what came next, the invasion of France. I read a novel, but I learned a lot of history along the way.The 16 page Introduction to the text is as concise and informative an overview of the lead up to, and beginning of, WW II I have ever encountered. It should be used in schools and textbooks. Seriously!In this novel Shaara sticks to his formula, each chapter is told from one character’s perspective, and the ever changing point of view gives a nice complete picture to all sides of the conflict. In this text we get in the heads of Eisenhower, George Patton, Erwin Rommel and occasionally of other historical players. However, the book really shines when we get the perspective of common soldiers. In this text Shaara creates two composite characters to achieve this effect. One is Jack Logan, a tank gunner in the North African campaign, and the other is Jesse Adams, a paratrooper in the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Although they are Shaara’s creations, he uses real things that happened to various GIs and has them happen with these two characters to show the life of the foot soldiers of this conflict. The novel is at its best when we are in combat. Shaara is one of the finest writers I have come across for recreating that experience. The invasion of Sicily is gripping. The author creates vivid and palpable tension as he writes of the US paratroopers jump into Sicily in July of 1943. The human emotions and technical details combine nicely in this section.I read this book quicker than I thought I would, was thrilled that it engaged me in the manner that it did, and I will be reading the other three novels Shaara has written about WW II. Can I say anything more than that that could endorse this book?",
            "The Rising Tide is the story of the American experience in the Second World War in Europe. The action picks up in Africa, waiting on Operation Torch to begin. As with other Shara books, the author follows some of the key actors - Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery, and, intriguingly, Rommel and Kesselring. It is through their eyes that the reader experiences the Desert campaign in North Africa as well as the invasion of Sicily and Italy by the allies.I appreciate the insight into the decision-making and strategy of the generals. This is especially true in the case of Rommel who is portrayed as a brilliant strategist/tactician who is serving a cause he does not fully support and commanders who are misguided at best and incompetent at worst. The lack of resources and bad orders cost the Germans multiple opportunities for devastating victories over the Allies.The perspective is a mixed blessing. While Rommel was interesting, some of the other perspectives were merely vaguely interesting. Exhibit A is Eisenhower who comes across as a bit of a cardboard automaton who emotionlessly builds his strategy and executes on the way to final victory. I would like to see more of the experience of the common soldier - or even a civilian caught up in things. To be fair, Shara does give his readers some of this. In North Africa we follow an American tank man who experiences the horror of taking under-armored American tanks into battle against heavy panzers. And in Sicily we get to follow a paratrooper into combat against an elite unit of SS troops. That was pretty cool.Outside of the perspective, I was taken aback by the beginning of the book. It starts right at the planning of Operation Torch. It felt odd. Somehow I thought it was going to begin earlier, even the invasion of Poland by the Germans. Coming into the war mid-way is disconcerting. Maybe it should have at least begun at the start of the war for the Americans?On the whole, three stars out of five. Shara does what he does. You either like it or you don't. I'm mixed on it. Of course, I will still read the next two books. I enjoy the history.",
            "The first book in Jeff Shaara's series on World War II focuses on the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one person. Some famous / historical such as Eisenhower, Patton, Rommel and others where the protagonist is a fictional character. Actually a composite of real GI's to provide the view of the citizen soldiers and their experiences. One of these fictional characters is Jack Logan, a tank gunner in the North African campaign. The other is Jesse Adams, a paratrooper in the Sicilian campaign.The book opens in 1939. The majority of Americans did not want to get involved and considered it a European problem. Churchill was desperate for help from the United States and Roosevelt tried to help (i.e. Lend Lease Act). Everything changed with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Dwight D. Eisenhower is named the supreme commander of the Allied forces in Mediterranean Theater of Operations. His generals include George Patton, Mark Clark, Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery. They don't often agree and sometimes it is hard to tell they are on the same side. On the other side is Erwin Rommel, the “the Desert Fox”, a veteran of many battles who hands the Allies their first defeat.Since each chapter was written from the perspective of these different characters the reader gets to know them. Their thoughts and perspectives. What is was like for Eisenhower who was a soldier but had to get everyone to work together for the common cause. Basically he was forced to be a diplomat. Not always easy when you are dealing with someone like Patton. Or those who thought the Americans were a bunch of cowboys. Lots of egos and personalities.As is usually the case in Shaara's stories the most interesting parts of the story are those that deal with with the common soldier. Here we have Jack Logan and Jesse Adams. To be in a tank in the middle of a battle. Or to jump out of a plane in the middle of a night not knowing what was below you.I would be interested in reading the other books in the series. At the end of this story the Allies prepare for Operation Overlord. The Battle of Normandy.",
            "Ever since reading Gods and Generals I have been convinced that Jeff Shaara doesn't have anything like the gift for writing his father, Shaara, Michael, exhibited in the breathtaking historical novel The Killer Angels. This book cemented my impression.If you want to read some interesting World War II history (specifically, the time period around the American entrance into the war in North Africa) that focuses on the personalities of the generals involved: this is a great resource. I have little doubt that the writing is very, very well-researched and I did learn things that (even as a minor WW2 buff) I didn't know about Patton, Eisenhower, Montgomery, Rommel, and others. I feel like I definitely *learned* something from reading this book. It just wasn't a lot of fun to do. It's like 3/4 a well-written textbook interspersed with 1/4 of a mediocre action novel.",
            "Shaara's books are always entertaining and this was my first of his that dealt with the subject of World War II. This book focused on the battles North Africa and then Italy. As always, Shaara writes each chapter from the perspective of one person and alternates between famous people and unknown soldiers to tell both the big picture and on the ground stories. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Eisenhower and Rommel - and some of the work on Patton as well. If you enjoy history, Shaara is can't miss.",
            "As much as I love all things Shaara, having consumed a dozen novels from Jeff and his father, Michael, The Rising Tide is probably my least favorite. IMO, the book tries to cover too much ground (literally). We read about the numerous conflicts between Rommel's panzer division (Germans), Montgomery's Desert Rats (Brits), Ike/Bradley/Patton (Americans), and Musolino's Republican Army, initially taking place in Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, etc. Then they proceed from Africa to Sicily, then Italy. The book reads more like a history book, than a typical Shaara novel that dives into the characters of a dozen or so key players. I learned a lot from reading The Rising Tide, but failed to become engaged in the story.",
            "My experience was the opposite of one of the reviewers here. I enjoyed the staff meetings in the interplay between the generals, particularly the diplomatic difficulty of Eisenhower as compared to the bluntness of Patton. For whatever reason, I didn't get into the battle scenes as much. Overall, I didn't find this book nearly as engaging as those of the Revolutionary, Mexican, and Civil War. Still, the author has earned my loyalty with his unique work, and I look forward to continuing to read this trilogy. It definitely makes one appreciate that victory in World War II was not a foregone conclusion.",
            "Jeff Shaara made an admirable attempt to complete his father's Civil War series, but his sequels, valuable though they are, could not hold a candle to The Killer Angel. Well, Jeff has done a lot of writing since then, and his WWII series, if The Rising Tide is a fair indication, matches the work of his father. What Michael Shaara did for the Civil War, his son is doing for the Second World War. One of the marks of good historical fiction, for me, is the way it prompts me to start researching stuff on the internet. And that's what I found myself doing in Tide. Another of telling sign happens when I find myself living what the characters are going through, and in Jeff's chapters on the tank battles between Rommel and the Allies, I felt the awe. To a lesser extent, only because this topic receives less coverage, is his portrayal of the training and daring of the paratroopers. There are many similar scenes in Tide - POW camps, stress disorders, command failures - that truly bring home the complexity of the topic to readers who have never experienced warfare at any level. The only other WWII series that does this so well is Herman Wouk's Winds of War, and War and Remembrance.The Rising Tide is a valuable addition to WWII fiction."],

          "reviews":["This 1865 novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, who also wrote the lovely North and South, is a pleasant but rather leisurely and lengthy tale of the personalities that inhabit an English country town in about the 1830's. The novel centers around Molly Gibson, the quiet and somewhat passive, but deeply sensitive, daughter of a widowed country doctor. We meet Molly and her father when she's an innocent 12 year old girl, about to spend the day visiting the estate of the local gentry, Lord and Lady Cumnor, so excited she can hardly sleep the night before. This visit won't turn out the way young Molly expected. These childhood scenes set the stage and introduce us to many of the characters who will play significant roles later on in the story. When Molly is a teenager one of her father's medical students, who boards with the Gibsons, falls in love with her. Mr. Gibson intercepts the young man's letter confessing his love and promptly ships Molly off to visit another local family and sends the young man away. But doing that isn't enough to allay Mr. Gibson's concerns, so he turns around and promptly proposes marriage to an attractive local widow (who has a daughter Molly's age), thinking a new mum for Molly is the ticket. It might have been a good idea to get to know her better before proposing. Just sayin'.Molly's new stepmother will prove a trial in her life (and in Molly's father's life as well, for that matter, although he's better able to deal with the disappointment, mostly by immersing himself further in his medical practice). Molly's new stepsister is much easier to get along with, but she'll also—eventually—end up bringing some serious complications to Molly's life. The first two-thirds of this novel was mildly enjoyable but didn't really engage me; I set the book aside several times while I read other books, without feeling terribly anxious to get back to it. Molly is sweet and kind and innocent, but I was getting a little impatient and frustrated with her and the people in her life. I seriously thought that I was going to have to rate this book three stars, and all my literary GR friends would be disappointed with me and my lack of taste and discernment and probably unfriend me en masse. Luckily for me, I really loved the last part of this book, enough to pull the overall rating up to four stars. The characters gradually became very real to me, with their quirks and failings described frankly, but with affectionate humor. Especially Mrs. Gibson, who sets new standards for bird-wittedness and vain self-absorption.Lady Cumnor: I was only speaking of the folly of people dressing above their station. — and what must the foolish woman do but begin to justify her own dress",

What a book.",
            " To begin with the old rigmarole of childhood. In a country there was a shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there was a house, and in that house there was a room, and in that room there was a bed, and in that bed there lay a little girl…  Wives and Daughters  reads like a fairytale and we are immediately enchanted by its gentle charm. Stepmother, prince, villain, woods, a ball, castle, climbing roses, birds and beasts. It's all there. However, the stepmother is not evil - just annoying and shallow. The prince is but a squire, the villain merely ungentlemanly. The woods is a friendly lesson in botany, the ball disappointing, the castle entailed, its timber rotting. Roses get tossed into the fire,'It is Mr. Preston,' said she, in answer to Molly. 'I shall not dance with him; and here go his flowers—'Into the very middle of the embers, which she immediately stirred down upon the beautiful shrivelling petals as if she wished to annihilate them as soon as possible. Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell spins this long leisurely tale with such attention to detail, characters, and dialogue that you feel transported to another time and place. And bittersweet it is. Death, blackmail, secret promises, undisclosed marriages, politics, scandal, the worry of money are ever present. Her 'wicked' characters are presented with enough sympathy that you enjoy them as much as the good ones. Take Hyacinth Gibson for example - she corresponds somewhat to Mrs. Bennet in  Pride and Prejudice. Austen totally denied all sympathy to tedious Mrs. Bennet, but Gaskell makes sure we see Hyacinth as a person - selfish and shallow - but not uninteresting, and not incapable of sincere kindness.And the good characters are flawed - sometimes you are not certain to which side they'll land. Or where you'll land, given the exasperating qualities some of them have. There is mystery too given to these people, hints dropped about things that are not revealed by the author.I am completely in love with  Wives and Daughters, so take my 5 stars you pretty little thing.",

At a time when the sensational novels were at the peak of their popularity",
            "MY HEART HURTSWHY DID THIS BOOK HAVE TO END",
            "Why has it taken me so long to finally read this wonderful novel? I bought the Penguin edition when I was in my 20s, read a page or two, put it down and didn't pick it up again. The book sat on my shelf for years. For all I know, it could be there still. However, after university I went right off Victorian literature and it's only been in the last twelve months or so that I've felt the desire to tackle it again. And now I've fallen in love with Elizabeth Gaskell's writing. In brief, the novel is set in the English Midlands in the 1830s and focuses on Molly Gibson, who lives in a small town with her widowed father, the local medical practitioner. Concerned to acquire an appropriate chaperone and guide for his teenage daughter, Mr Gibson re-marries the vain, self-absorbed and manipulative Hyacinth Kirkpatrick, who has a teenage daughter of her own, Cynthia. The story of Molly and Cynthia is a tale of love, friendship, secrets and scandal. Central to the narrative are the changes in English society, where class distinctions are slowly becoming blurred. The best thing about this novel are its characters. There is kind, loving Molly, her sarcastic and undemonstrative but deeply caring father, her truly awful stepmother and the fascinating",
            "2020 reread:My Jane Austen book group is reading this book, a great excuse for a reread, as it is one of my favorites of all time. I also remain firm in my belief that it is one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century. George Elliott certainly thought so--she admitted that this book was the inspiration for her great novel Middlemarch.I do think that this book is in conversation with Jane Austen on a number of levels, first being that what women thought matters. All kinds of women, whatever their rank, age, or economic status.On this reread, I noticed how much fun the narrative voice has with small town life whatever the rank. There is so much humor veining the sharp observations of human vagaries, underscoring how much Gaskell's writing had changed. She always aimed for great things, though her earlier novels (and Dickens scolded her for daring to write beyond the female writer's natural sphere of domestic life) are problematical",
            "Whilst Wives and Daughters isn't my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell, I loved the insight in to 19th century domestic life, especially the customs, relationships and descriptions of rural living.Our heroine, Molly Gibson, is unassuming and quiet, yet has an inner steely determination and steadfast values that I really appreciated. All the characters, in fact, feel like they have been drawn from life, and I particularly enjoyed the way that Mrs Gibson was characterised - she was highly irritating in places, yet I couldn't help but like her! I believe I would have felt more positively about Wives and Daughters if the plot had been tighter in places and not so rambling, but I also appreciate that it was published posthumously and so possibly not revised to Gaskell's usual standards. I'll definitely be revisiting this - especially as it is so revealing about the way in which people lived, which I always love reading about! Give me the mundane details any day; they're always the best. "],

The young slave's love for a white girl who slakes his forbidden thirst for learning and his painful relationship with his father are hauntingly evoked in this novel of astonishing lyrical simplicity. It is a measure of D'Aguiar's achievement and bravery that The Longest Memory is informed not only by the complicities between black slave and white master but also by the tensions among slaves themselves - between stoic survivalists and passionate rebels.

It's written in a highly accessible way. It does a great job of highlighting the issues associated with slavery and tells a twisted tale. All the characters are memorable. Chapters are written from varying perspectives of each of the main characters. And there's a special chapter written as editorials from the local paper that reinforces attitudes of the time. A shameful era, and a very well written story. 5 stars.",

            "This book is super ambitious in both subject and structure. D'Aguiar's trademark poesy creates layers of subtlety and intimation that bear multiple reads. Whitechapel the elder slave (more on that later) is sufficiently tortured by his fealty to the institution of slavery, and his subsequent betrayal of his son. The journal entries from Sanders Sr. comprise my favorite chapter; the complex motivations and moral quandaries the old overseer grapples with feel strangely relatable, albeit through the tarnished lens of rape and racism. Lydia and Chapel's relationship is appropriately bittersweet; though I had issues with the layout of the chronology and POVs, knowing that he is already doomed heightens both the drama and the futility.4-Star Issues: mostly minor, though noticeable. Having one name recycled for so many concurrent characters -- Mr. Whitechapel the master, Mr. Whitechapel his son, Whitechapel the old slave, Chapel his son -- would be hard enough to pull off with a one-direction, single-perspective narrator; the chaotic back-and-forth between past, present, and future left me disoriented on occasion.Things that give me pause but are not CANCEL WORTHY:1) Whitechapel marrying a woman younger than his own great-granddaughter. Just a little weird to grapple with in 2020.2) The ham-fisted editorials in The Virginian. The glaring hints that Miss L was in fact Lydia could have been pared back slightly without losing any but the densest of readers.3) The piece at the end where Whitechapel muses about how The master is daylight",

            "In her latest novel, Douglass’ Women, Jewel Parker Rhodes travels back in history to the antebellum and Civil War era to examine the loves of Frederick Douglass. She stretches the imagination by exploring the psyche of Anna, a free woman of color, who loves Douglass almost to a fault and Ottilie Assing, a European, free-spirit who is attracted to the polished and principled Douglass.The novel, told in chronological alternating chapter format, provides the reader a glimpse into the character and upbringing of each woman. Anna is a quiet, hardworking homemaker, devoted wife and mother who clings to the belief that love conquers all. She has a strong sense of family and has witnessed unconditional love between her parents and siblings. Her one wish is to have the same love returned to her from Douglass. Unfortunately, Douglass, a self-taught ex-slave, has been elevated to a level of celebrity and lifestyle that pushes Anna to the background where she reluctantly finds comfort. While her husband is recognized as a skilled orator and accomplished author, Anna is regarded as a recluse and intentionally remains illiterate (despite Douglass’ urging otherwise) which creates an erudite chasm between them that widens as the years progress. Ottilie Assing, a genteel woman of German-Jewish ancestry, works as Douglass’ interpreter. She fills the intellectual void and accompanies Douglass on many engagements. They grow fond of each other and a lifetime love affair begins.Rhodes writes very vividly so the reader clearly understands the similarities, differences, jealousy, envy, and anger each woman feels toward each other and Douglass. Rhodes also parallels the societal prejudices of Jews in Europe to Africans in America which justifies Ottilie’s attraction to Abolitionist views. She also subtly touches the issues surrounding interracial relationships through her character’s dialogue and thoughts. Although this is a work of historical fiction, she carefully follows the actual timeframe of events to effortlessly blend in factual people, places, and excerpts from speeches, which lends credibility to the novel. From a literary standpoint, her use of the “water-death-freedom” symbolism was handled expertly and was used as the unifying thread for both women’s tales. This reader believes that fans of Rhodes will not be disappointed; this is a good story from an accomplished author!",
            "This was such a good read. I found I could not put it down. I'm familiar with Frederick Douglass. I read the autobiography he wrote in high school. I also learned in college that he supported the suffragettes in their ideals of universal suffrage. So, I felt like I was familiar with his character. This novel exposed a side of him I was totally unfamiliar with. A much less savory, less honorable side. I strongly support fleshing out and adding a touch of realism to historical characters but this felt almost too much. Mostly he was self absorbed and embarrassed by his dark, illiterate wife. I had read that Douglass and his wife worked on the Underground Railroad but that was not included in the book. Ultimately this was well written, well handled and well researched. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
            "Wow! Amazing, compelling, and facinating story of two women who deeply love the same man. Unfortunately his heart belongs to politics and power. Hmmmmm! Sounds familiar. This story takes place in the 1800's, but why does it make me think of many of our recent past and current leaders? ",
            "What a wonderful book. Ms. Rhodes managed to capture two heroine's unique voices in a single book. I am enamored with this story; never want it to end. I'll sip slowly like a sweet hot cup of tea... I finished and it is clear, Rhodes took time studying the life of each of these women and how they related to Douglass. I enjoyed how rich each character was, and in the end found the women were very similar in so many ways. From their loves of their mothers, beliefs in the supernatural and spirit worlds, and also their love for Douglass and the children he and Anna had together. It also goes to show that no one is perfect and some people cannot just make a choice and stick with it for life. They are forever wanting more. Is that wrong? This is a wonderful book. I loved it and highly recommend to others.",
            "Although, this is fiction..My understanding is that is based on some true aspects of Frederick Douglas life. I have always been fond of Frederick Douglas work, but never knew the dual life he led and the relationship he had with the white women while his wife who was barely literate was home having his children. Ms. Rhodes writes this story in a way that catches the readers attention where you don't really hate anyone, but feel sorry for both women. Both women gave something to Mr. Douglas and you as the reader are not sure that they got back what they lost. Neither women alone was enough for Mr. Douglas. That in theory is a sad scenario for any woman. Very good read.",

            "This book was good. However, I did not like the way Frederick Bailey Douglass cheated on Anna Douglass with Ottilie. Douglas could have made Anna's life more easier, but no..... In the end, He didn't choose Ottilie either after the passing of Anna. He got to big for his britches!",
            "Douglass’ WomenBy Jewell Parker RhodesMs. Rhodes is an excellent writer. Her research is nearly flawless, attest to her citations at the end of the book. Her added fiction builds a passionate, emotional story.“Douglass’ Women” is about two very different women loving the same strong, ex-slave, abolitionist, a writer. I believe Ms. Rhodes knew Frederick Douglass had to be included in the story to understand his women. He is an escaped slave afraid of being enslaved again, even by the women in his life. Consequently, he juggles them, accepting their love with little emotional return.Anna Murray Douglass is a free black woman. She’s the stronger of the two women, the realist. She gives her hard-earned money to Freddy to escape his slave master. He later marries her. Anna says Freddy is “Samson-man, standing, perched on the edge of his horizon.” She does not like the name Frederick Bailey Douglass, feels it beyond her as his mate. Anna is steadfast in her loyalty and self-confidence and suffers his infidelity.Ottilie Assing, a German-Jewish woman, teaches him to read and write, and uses his ego and hatred of bondage to keep him near. He becomes Frederick to Ottilie. She is indispensable with her money and time helping him pursue his career. She clearly has a way out of the mistress role, but is too much of a romantic in love to accept the reality of her situation.Both women suffer the pains of unreciprocated love, heartache from their “great man.” They learn Freddy/Frederick doesn’t tell either one he loves her. Anna says, “Freddy never really learned to love.”I can only conclude that Frederick, husband, lover, and abolitionist is mentally disturbed as a result of his years as a slave. Freedom is the only thing he seems to focus on. This proves to create both bad and good events in his life. Nevertheless, he needs sexual love, takes it wherever he can get it, when he wants it. Yet, it does not interfere with his plans, in spite of the fact that he fathers five children with Anna. His intimate relationship with Ottilie beats his subconscious. Frederick has no time for women’s suffrage — says that can come later. He refuses to admit that he is color conscious. He tells Rosetta “I’m married to an old black log. Would you repeat my mistake?” In speaking of his oldest daughter’s love interest, Lucius, he says, “We’re at war...Fighting for racial uplift. Not degradation.” And further says, “I raised you for better than this. Better than him.” Dear timid Lucius cannot read nor write, but loves Rosetta Douglass.Every page kept me immersed, kept me wondering what next. Jewell Parker Rhodes penned vivid pictures of strong fictional characters, which reflects her understanding of humankind. What an excellent read!Reviewed by Minnie Estelle MillerAuthor of “Whispers from the Mirror.”July 6, 2011"],

I'll be here, sitting on the floor surrounded by cupcakes, ice cream and some twisted books, like an existentialist Bridget Jones, just contemplating my own ridiculous existence, thanks to you guys and your crude and insightful comments about life and its inevitable absurdity. It is a tough read. Especially if you feel like a giant failure that never lived, but existed (to live, one of the rarest thing in the world, according to another great writer). I don't know about the life situation (and mental health condition) of you people out there, so I will certainly avoid the pressure of recommending this book.

            "(Book 602 from 1001 books) - La Nausée = Nausea, Jean-Paul SartreNausea is a philosophical novel by the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, published in 1938. It is Sartre's first novel and, in his opinion, one of his best works. Antoine Roquentin protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has been living in Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversationsو and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his research on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a sweetish sickness",
            "SARTRE HAD IT RIGHT; BUT HE TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY.His Nausea is an undisputed MASTERPIECE. But like me at my coming of age, he covered up its huge insights into his own failings behind a Facade of Self-Deception.In this book, Sartre saw correctly that our world is Crazy Sick. But by sidestepping the problem of his own sickness through Reason, he made it worse for himself. And in the end he died of it.That’s his problem. If we don’t admit we’re all infected with this Crazy Sickness, we won’t seek - or find - REAL HELP. We’ll be in Terminal Denial. We all need Help.Don't get me wrong. I think nausea IS the only authentic reaction to modern life. Its hypocrisy sickens, of course - and Sartre is at least right in that. But then, afterward, acceptance of all that is ESSENTIAL. Gotta bite the bullet.The other day, I decided to skim this novel again, after so many years had passed since I read it, and was thunderstruck. Why? Because it describes exactly the same experience I had 50 years ago! It’s an experience which has continued uninterrupted since that time - see my Kindle notes.When I read this book in the 1980´s I must have ignored its meaning. It was Crazy Sickness. It’s everywhere. It’s the Barthian experience of the Alterity of God. Sartre, ever the pessimistic atheist, thought it was the perception of the nothingness of middle-class values. And that’s too bad.T.S. Eliot says some people have the experience and miss the meaning. Many are called but few are chosen. So most folks, perhaps, prize this epiphany in their memory for the rest of their lives but are not fundamentally changed by it. Fred Buechner, though, said we have to SPEAK FROM OUR PAIN...And to see results after such a satori, hard work must follow. And I wrestled with it, as I say, for 50 years. It was a long, cold, hard slog. Until, finally, peace and freedom ensued. But Roquentin - Sartre - just endured its temporary internal pressure for a while, and then continued toward pure futility on his angry, counter cultural way. With great anguish.So it’s a groundbreaking novel about the thunderous, dual irruption of being and facticity into a young man’s life, and for him everything is left in the air for the one who experiences it.You know, it always happens in exactly this way.For at that very moment when we try to seize the prize of Pure Being for ourselves we are necessarily forced to wrestle with a phony world of Being-for-Others - becoming ACTORS in a world we didn’t create.The result is earthshaking for poor, nondescript Roquentin! He, like unlucky Prometheus, has suddenly and shamefacedly stolen Fire from the gods. And a pretty tawdry bunch of gods they’ve turned out to be in his judgemental eyes. But Roquentin grabbed the stick by the Wrong end. You just have to just KEEP GOING - and d*mn the Torpedoes!Once you cross that invisible line in front of your unwary feet, the world falls on its stunned head, and proper orientation is anyone’s guess.Where truth lies now is in unending aporia... a banal flux for Sartre, who had like Nietzsche, transvalued all traditional values, and suddenly:All is changed, changed UTTERLY -A Terrible Beauty is born!A similar thing happened to me when I was a kid. It was pivotal in my development and in my choices as an adult. I had to choose, and fast! It’s like George Santayana said: one day you wake up and realize “life’s not a spectacle - it’s a struggle.”But for me, it originated from God, I was certain of it. I submitted myself to His Absolute Alterity. Once you’re on that road, there’s no going back. You can’t go home. At least at first...You know, Kafka once wrote a paragraph or two in his notebooks on the Prometheus parable, which describes the anguish that must follow such an experience for us all.He says, that after incalculable aeons, Prometheus, his chains, and the rock he’s chained to in punishment for his sins, all merge into one continuous solid entity.That merging is our return to Wholeness. And the ordinary sensory world - totally divested of extraneous pop gobbledygook - is now “magnifique, totale et solitaire”.For if we endure the factitious encounter with Becoming patiently, and “in good faith”, one day we will merge with the Rock of Being in peace.It is painfully and near-impossibly difficult. But that is the Path.And it is the Path to our Freedom and Wholeness.One hundred years before Sartre penned this novel, a great Dane suffered the same cataclysmic bifurcation of his being - and, at first, the same unutterable anguish. For him it led to Wholeness too.His name was Søren Kierkegaard. But - crucially, and in stark contradistinction to Sartre - Kierkegaard found blessed release from it in the end. Sporadically at first, but you can see final freedom was there.You can see his solution in his short masterwork Fear and Trembling...Through a series of subtle and cuttingly double-edged variations on the old, old story of Abraham and Isaac - the original sacrifice - he lays the immovable foundation of Postmodernist Christian Faith. Seen from almost every possible type of viewpoint out of a myriad range of possibilities.And his ineluctable inner logic overpowered all his naysayers.In fact Fear and Trembling paved the way for such modern cutting-edge Christians as Karl Barth and Hans Kung, both the brains trust and the conscientious soul of our new 21st century churches - institutions that seem to the untrained eye to be so out of touch.Perhaps they’re only out of touch to the jaundiced eyes of Big Brother Media. Just try to look at it all a bit deeper! These thinkers are the substance under the New Christians’ (somewhat regrettable) glitter. All that glitters is not gold:You’ve gotta KNOW yourself as well as the World. By dissing the world you’re just digging a bigger hole.And though Sartre somewhat hastily discarded Modern Faith out of hand, we don’t necessarily have to make the same despairing mistake, nor would we have to undergo any more desperate Sartrian anguish, if we chose to do otherwise...and Believe.For the choice we can make, right now, is for Real Inner Peace. The peace of a painfully and patiently stoic Promethean Rock...Which must appear also to be in this ugly world, for so many of us, the Transcendence of a troubled Cross.But that for us is The Only Way, the Only Truth and the Only Life.And that way Works.Roquentin’s doesn’t.We must Accept, and NOT Eternally Reject the Truth.",
            "The protagonist is a captive of loneliness and time.This sun and blue sky were only a snare. This is the hundredth time I've let myself be caught. My memories are like coins in the devil's purse: when you open it you find only dead leaves.For him there are no expectations and no changes in life… The world passes him by…I can no longer distinguish present from future and yet it lasts, it happens little by little…So the protagonist becomes nauseated with reality and his purposeless existence turns into a mental torment. I was just thinking that here we sit, all of us, eating and drinking to preserve our precious existence and really there is nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.It comes as no surprise, however… Even God couldn’t find out a reason for his existence: “And God said unto Moses, I am that I am,” Exodus 3:14.There is a paradox though: Why bother? If existence is meaningless then any philosophy is useless…",
            "Originally published in 1938, Jean-Paul Sartre's short existential novel La Nausée can be read on many levels - to list several: philosophical, psychological, social and political. Going back to my college days, my reading of this work has always been decidedly personal. Thus my observations below and, at points, my own experiences relating to certain passages I have found to contain great power. Then the Nausea sized me",
            "SOME OF THESE DAYSDisegno di Alberto Giacometti.Libro letto nel momento giusto, quando il termine e la categoria ‘esistenzialismo’ me li sarei potuti scrivere sulle t-shirt, o in fronte.Leggo che l'editore Gallimard chiese a Sartre di cambiare il titolo, da “Melancholia” a “La nausea”, giudicando il primo poco attraente per i lettori. Una bella lotta.Altrettanto buffo è che Sartre abbia sentito il bisogno di un impianto tanto classico. Perché, anche se lo fa dichiarare ai suoi editori, l’espediente che avvia il romanzo è per l’appunto un super classico: manoscritto ritrovato, diario di un certo Roquentin, che s’è ritirato a vivere in provincia per fare ricerche su un tizio del secolo XVIII, tale marchese di Rollebon.Alberto Giacometti: Annette.Oltre Roquentin, che parla in prima persona, s’incontra qualche altro personaggio degno di nota, pochi a dir il vero. Su tutti, l’Autodidatta che Roquentin incrocia in biblioteca: l’Autodidatta è intento a leggere, e possibilmente, imparare lo scibile umano seguendo l’ordine alfabetico. Bell’impresa.Appare anche un compositore musicale ebreo e una cantante di colore, Some of These Days è la sua canzone.Sotto forma di diario, racconti, soprattutto pensieri e riflessioni, sul senso della vita, che senso non ha, sulla solitudine, sull’angoscia. Mal di vivere.La Nausea non è in me: io la sento laggiù sul muro, sulle bretelle, dappertutto attorno a me. Fa tutt’uno col caffè, son io che sono in essa.Lungo la strada ce n’è per tutto e tutti, dio, ovviamente, borghesi, benpensanti, conformisti, la stupidità umana…Alberto Giacometti: Studio per un ritratto di James Lord.Inizia riportando anche la data, la prima è Lunedì, 29 gennaio 1932. Ma presto rimangono solo i giorni della settimana, a rimarcare l’inutilità del tutto, l’inconsistenza dell’esistere.A un certo punto si legge, semplicemente:MartedìNiente. Esistito.L’inferno, sono gli altri.",
            "Third time lucky...I have always preferred the work of Albert Camus when it comes to the subject of 'existentialism'. It has taken me three attempts to read Nausea to finally appreciate. Whereas I just found Camus easier to digest immediately. This small novel is no doubt an important work and essential reading for philosophical purposes. I remember reading Camus's 'The Stranger and Sartre's Nausea back to back, similar in some ways, not in others, The Stranger lingered for weeks, Nausea drifted away. But for whatever reason, this time around things just clicked. Maybe it helped reading 'The Age of Reason' to finally grasp him, the fact I am a fan of Simone de Beauvoir should mean looking at Sartre in a better light, after all he took her under his wing during her creative days at university. They enjoyed each others company, and this goes to show men and women can become great friends without becoming lovers. Sartre, writer and philosophy professor has certainly embedded himself in literary history, and would say he could have been viewed as the French Kafka by virtue of his gift for expressing the horror of certain intellectual situations, if it weren’t that his ideas, unlike those of the author of “The Great Wall of China,” were not completely foreign to moral problems. Kafka always questioned the meaning of life. Sartre only questions the fact of existence, which is an order of reality much more immediate than the human and social elaborations of the life that is on this side of life.“Nausea,” the journal of Antoine Roquentin, is the novel of absolute solitude, a solitude that made me feel uncomfortable. It is a question here of nothing but the spiritual results of solitude. They are analyzed with a rigor of thought and expression that will no doubt seem intolerable to most readers. Now I see the light, a philosophical novelist of the first order. Since Voltaire, we know that in France the philosophical novel has been a light genre, not far from the fable. Sartre’s literature bears no relation to this frivolous genre, but it gives a very good idea of what a literature associated to an existentialist philosophy might be. The law of the man who is rigorously alone is not the fear of nothingness, but the fear of existence. This discovery takes us far.If his first novel was a work without a solution, by which I mean that it no more opens up any solutions for the universe than the principal works of Dostoevsky, it would perhaps be a singular success without a successor. But with its final pages “Nausea” is not a book without a solution. Jean-Paul Sartre who throughout the novel paints a portrait of a great bourgeois city of social caricature, and has gifts as a novelist that are too precise and too cruel not to result in great denunciations, not to completely open up into reality, a reality I would rather not see.A seminal work that I will come to appreciate even more over the space of time.",
            "“Some of these days You’ll miss me honey”«Η ναυτία» είναι η λογοτεχνική κατάληξη της θεωρίας του μοναχικού ανθρώπου που καταστρέφεται. Μέσα στον τρόμο της μάταιης αναζήτησης νοήματος,απεικονίζονται με κάθε λεπτομέρεια μη βιώσιμοι ήρωες, τρομακτικοί, θλιβεροί,αφόρητοι. Εκτός απο τη θλίψη της διάλυσης τους υπάρχει και η οδυνηρή συνειδητοποιημένη κατάσταση πως είναι κενές και ανεπαρκείς υποστάσεις. Υπάρξεις χωρίς παρελθόν, χωρίς μέλλον, μέσα σε ένα παρόν που το διαπερνά η μεταφυσική θλίψη της διάλυσης «ΚΑΘΕ ΥΠΑΡΞΗ ΓΕΝΝΙΕΤΑΙ ΑΝΑΙΤΙΑ ΖΕΙ ΑΠΟ ΑΔΥΝΑΜΙΑ ΚΑΙΠΕΘΑΙΝΕΙ ΤΥΧΑΙΑ»Ο Αντουάν Ροκαντέν (συμβολικά κωμικό, σημαίνει ο γελοίος γέρος που παριστάνει τον νεαρό και έχει κάνει το δικό του γύρο του κόσμου)είναι ο πρωταγωνιστής του βιβλίου. Είναι ο «συλλογικός άνθρωπος» που απορροφάται συνεχώς και έντονα απο την παρατήρηση της δίκης του ύπαρξης. Αναλογίζεται το γεγονός ότι υπάρχει, υπάρχει σαν μια συνείδηση που συνδέεται με το σώμα του οποίου το συλλογικό όνομα είναι Αντουάν Ροκαντέν. Η αντίδραση για μια τέτοια συνειδητοποίηση θα μπορούσε να χαρακτηριστεί ως παντοδυναμία, ως θαύμα -της ανθρώπινης νόησης ή παρανόησης- μιας ανώτερης δύναμης. Για τον Αντουάν όμως, η αντίδραση που προκύπτει είναι ο απόλυτος τρόμος. Τον διαπνέει εξ ολοκλήρου μια αντίληψη για την κενή, ριζωμένη ύπαρξη που οδηγεί σε ψυχοσωματικές αισθήσεις. Η κυριότερη αίσθηση ονομάζεται Ναυτία. Για να αποφύγει τη ναυτία ο Αντουάν βυθίζεται στη μελέτη του παρελθόντος, ζει σε μια κωμόπολη της Γαλλίας και μελετά καθημερινά για να γράψει τη βιογραφία ενός πονηρού τυχοδιώκτη, του Μαρκήσιου ντε Ρολμπόν. Η καθημερινότητα του εκφραζει ποικιλία ιδεών και νοημάτων. Στον καθημερινό περίπατο της αστικής τάξης που προκαλεί ναυτία, μαθαίνουμε πως οι αστοί είναι καθάρματα και εξαπατημένες μα ισχυρές υπάρξεις. Στην τοπική βιβλιοθήκη νιώθουμε την ουσία του αστικού ανθρωπισμού και της αισιοδοξίας. Σύμφωνα όμως με τον Αντουάν, δεν υπάρχει στην αναζήτηση της σημασίας της ζωής καμία θέση ανθρωπισμού ή ελπίδας. Απο την πρώην αγαπημένη του έχουμε μια άλλη προοπτική για την ύπαρξη. Σύμφωνα με την Άννυ τα παιδικά κατάλοιπα ριζώνουν για πάντα στη συνείδηση και η υπέρβαση της ύπαρξης μας είναι το μεγαλείο του θανάτου. Ο θάνατος είναι μια «προνομιούχος κατάσταση» εξαιτίας της σημασίας που του αποδίδεται όχι μόνο στην πραγματικότητα αλλά και ως θέμα σε πολλά έργα τέχνης. Γραμμένη σαν ένα είδος ημερολογίου «η Ναυτία» διαβάζεται ως μνημείο αφορισμών για την ύπαρξη και το αντίθετο της. Ειρωνεία,μοναξιά, απόγνωση, θλίψη, σαρκασμός εμπεριέχονται ως βαθιά υποκειμενικές απόψεις. «Η Ναυτία» θριαμβεύει στην πειστική εκφραστικότητα που προσδίδει ο Σαρτρ στον πρωταγωνιστή του βιβλίου.Ο Αντουάν καταφέρνει να μεταφέρει με απόλυτα διαυγή γλώσσα τις ιδέες και τις σκέψεις που βρίσκονται πίσω απο τις απλές ερμηνείες, το πετυχαίνει τέλεια με τον αποκεφαλισμό της ύπαρξης του. Είναι άκομψος και εσωστρεφής, κυκλοθυμικός και απαισιόδοξα διαλυμένος, όμως αναλύει εξαιρετικά τη φύση και χαρίζει απλόχερα διανοητική ενέργεια και βασανιστικούς τρόπους κατανόησης της εξομολόγησης του. «Η Ναυτία» είναι το πρώτο έργο του Σαρτρ που διαβάζω και νομίζω πως θα είναι και το τελευταίο. Ένιωσα τρομερή πίεση, θλίψη και απέραντη ψυχολογική πίεση σε βαθμό φθοράς. Μια θηλιά στο λαιμό που έσφιγγε σταδιακά μέχρι να γίνει αφόρητα πνιγηρή... και μία αίσθηση ναυτίας ...Καλή ανάγνωση.

Almost every character in the book dies at some point, by all kinds of different means.

It deals with topics such as xenophobia, racism, rumor, discrimination, poverty, AIDS, and crime all within its covers. Another thing that sets the book apart is the second person narration that talks not back to the reader but to the protagonist of the story who has already passed when the book begins. It chronicles the events leading to his death revealing the entire picture in starts and stops that jump around a bit but add to the allure. This is a great book to spend an afternoon reading.

            "Benvenuti a Hillbrow è un romanzo basato sulla descrizione delle difficili condizioni di Hillbrow, un’area ghettizzata di Johannesburg, un tempo zona di soli bianchi, oggi luogo ibrido, meta degli immigrati dal resto dell’Africa, sovrappopolato, degradato, brulicante di vita ma anche segnato dalla morte e dalla violenza.Usando diversi stili letterari come il realismo magico e il flusso di coscienza, l’autore descrive la vita della città dopo la fine dell’apartheid, affrontando temi come la xenofobia tra africani, l’AIDS, la droga e la prostituzione.Fin dall’inizio del libro sappiamo che il giovane protagonista Refentše è morto, ma continua a essere l’interlocutore cui il narratore si rivolge. Buona parte del romanzo ricostruisce gli eventi della sua vita fino al suicidio, come fosse una cronaca di una morte annunciata, intrecciandoli con le storie di altri personaggi, anch’essi quasi tutti indirizzati al suicidio, alla tossicodipendenza, alla follia o alla malattia, ma destinati a ricongiungersi a lui in Paradiso.Violenza, povertà, omofobia, droga, xenofobia, misoginia, superstizione, dilagare irrefrenabile di Aids, contrasto tra la tradizione dei villaggi e i nuovi stili di vita della metropoli costituiscono il quotidiano che provoca il costante disorientamento delle giovani generazioni rappresentate in questo romanzo.Mpe si ribella alla realtà decadente della Hillbrow in cui vive soltanto sette anni prima di gettarsi all’età di 34 anni dal ventesimo piano del palazzo in cui abita, malato di AIDS.È un romanzo duro, appassionato, visionario, difficile da leggere nonostante la sua brevità, in cui Mpe porta avanti la propria campagna contro gli stereotipi e i pregiudizi, di qualsiasi tipo essi siano.Forse è proprio la presenza continua di violenze, stupri, suicidi, malattie a diminuire un po’ l’efficacia del messaggio contenuto nel romanzo, poiché queste violenze divengono parte di un mondo alienante che ad un certo punto immaginiamo lontano ed irreale.",
            "And so, South African season kicks off. I've been meaning to read this since picking it up in Joburg a few years ago and getting suddenly 'back into' things South African on reading Mr Flanery's (okay, he's American) wonderful novel, 'Absolution' (which itself reminded me of the unique conditions and rawness of SA literature - which is why I find it so darn interesting). Here's a short, lyrical little number set among Hillbrow migrants, but focusing as much on where they've migrated from. It takes us too to Oxford (in fact, there was something perhaps unintentionally touching about how 'Oxford' in this case meant 'Oxford Brookes'. NB I went to UCL). I'm absolutely fascinated by what happened to Hillbrow (having gone through it in a taxi and been strongly advised to be terrified), so am very easy to please on this front. It's all there: crime, AIDS, xenophobia, drugs, suicide - but of course this is also a tale of love, betrayal and rural superstition. A distinctive, street-inflected voice - often surprisingly funny (especially when we get sexual and head to the 'Southern regions' and things carnal). Linguistically and metaphorically pretty interesting too, to a UK reader (the idea, for example of 'the other bone of my heart'). So, touching and lyrical. Next up (or next-up-but-one): The Restless Supermarket (which I suspect might Do Good Hillbrow too).",
            "Suicidal ideation on a large scale? Did the author actually kill himself at 34 or was there a different cause of death?I just couldn't really get fully into it. I didn't love the writing style. I don't know. I thought it would somehow be better..Have more to it.",
            "Mpe was a literary painter of note. Saddening that he did not live long enough to write more novels. I enjoyed the style of his writing more than the story. The protagonist's omniscient voice puts the reader to a quizzical and introspective perspective.",

I loved the characters and loved how the book seemed to be coming from a collective voice and predicted perspective. I think there's so much value in this book if you read into the words in addition to just reading it from face value. I took a more academic/literature deconstruction of this book. I enjoyed this read as it was initally something I wasn't super familiar with. The only thing I kind of got lost in was some of the descriptions. I don't know the area well and sometimes I felt as though the descriptions of places let my mind drift in away from what I was reading. That being said, that is a difficulty I have with reading particularly descriptive passages and books.",

          "description":["Here's another Star Wars spinoff novel, a brisk and extremely uncomplicated action-adventure romp set on planet Coruscant immediately before the events of The Phantom Menace. After a few setting-up exercises, it's essentially a prolonged chase sequence whose implacable pursuer is Darth Maul--the almost absurdly villainous-looking Sith Lord with the biggest lightsaber and worst makeup job in the entire saga to date. The plot? Insidiously evil Darth Sidious is poised to launch the Naboo trade blockade featured in The Phantom Menace. But one of his alien henchmen has sneaked away to betray this scheme and must die. So must the traitor's contacts, smalltime crook Lorn Pavan and his uppity droid, I-Five. Likewise Darsha Assant, the female Jedi Knight apprentice who gets entangled with Pavan through either mind-boggling coincidence or the mysterious ways of the Force. Michael Reaves makes a reasonably slick job of all this nonsense and is not afraid of clichés. Plenty of characters have wooden lines like \"I've got a bad feeling about this,\" and \"Too many questions, and not enough answers.\" Meanwhile in the Jedi council, Yoda makes characteristic remarks: \"A good choice he would be... No accident this was.\" Unfortunately, the well-known story line of The Phantom Menace defuses suspense in Shadow Hunter. That trade blockade has to happen despite the good folks' doomed heroics, and horrible Darth Maul (already far more powerful and deadly than the puny opposition he faces here) is fated to win out. This novel is for dedicated fans only. --David Langford"],

            "Urgh, I really dislike writing negative reviews but in this case I've got to go that way. I felt all along that this book was going to take an unexpected turn and suddenly a lot of the shaky plotting and contrivances would be forgiven but...no. Ultimately it just felt like a then this happens",
            "My reaction to this book:First,[image error]",
            "Good story, well done. Having fewer ensemble cast members of the Star Wars pantheon gives the author more outcome flexibility, but knowing where the story has to end up still gives the reader too much knowledge of what has to happen to the non-canon players. (Is that a spoiler?)The more I'm exposed to the SW universe, the more the technology baffles me. First, over the span of about five thousand years a galaxie--stuffed with advanced cultures--seems to make no technology improvements--despite wars, famine and floods (well, maybe no floods). Travel, weapons, communications, etc. all seem frozen at one level. Look at what's happened here in the last five hundred years.Second, more like a quibble, the lack of communication between Jedi less than twenty kilometers from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is a major element of this story, and it makes no sense. First, they should all have comm implants. So their comm links don't get lost, stolen, or broken. Then, they ought to track each other through the Force, if nothing else. I would think Darsha's mentor would be monitoring her through the Force every minute she's on her final exam assignment. Considering what she went through and how she reacted to it",

            "Michael Reaves does a good job with Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter. I was impressed. I was wondering if I'd ever give another Star Wars book more than two stars.Of course the problem with Darth Maul is that he is mainly visual and doesn't have much in the way of any kind of character. His hopes and dreams are rudimentary and his goal is to kill and destroy wherever his master (Darth Sidious a.k.a. the future Emperor Palaptine) sends him.Speaking of Sidious",

            "Darth Sidious is about to implement his plan of a trade blockade when one of his “partners” in the scheme goes missing, planning to sell the information he has to whoever will pay the most. Sidious sends his apprentice Darth Maul to find the traitor. The action takes place on Coruscant, as the Neimoidian gets set to make a deal with Lorn Pavan, a broker of all things worth money. A Jedi Padawan sent to Coruscant on a test mission, fails in her job, eventually crossing paths with Pavan and his droid I Five. They are all now on Darth Maul’s death list, fighting for their lives, escaping over and over with a lot of good fortune.This is a light weight novel: Easy and quick to read but not completely satisfying. When dealing with a character like Darth Maul I wanted the tone to be darker, but it was too tame. I didn’t feel the evil that Maul supposedly possesses. As the odd circumstances that let his quarry escape pile up you get the feeling the author didn’t really know what to do with this set up to make it compelling. Also, for a novel that has Darth Maul’s name in the title, there wasn’t enough of the character in the story. I felt like I read more about the other characters than the lead."],
