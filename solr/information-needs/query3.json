          "description":"For many years, the Seven Realms has been a peaceful land under one High King. A place untroubled by sorcery, in which the farmers of Heseldorn tend their fields, the warriors of Thaeonasta guard the pass to the Northern wastes, and the fellstalkers of Pendren continue their solitary wanderings on the wild fells. But it is also a land in which men touch iron ere they speak of elves, and the age-old alliance between the dwarves of the Grey Mountains and the men of Morieth has foundered in enmity and mistrust. Now King Praeledin is lost, a usurper sits on the throne of Arumet, and savage kralg overwhelm the land, murdering all in their path. If the Seven Realms is to be saved, a small company must battle dark magic, bloodthirsty pursuers, and their own age-old prejudices to find their lost King. This is a story of loyalty, friendship, sacrifice and love, for adult readers who enjoy Heroic Fantasy. The Rising Dark is the first book of The Charndras trilogy.",

            "review":"All in all, this book is enjoyable. The pace is a little slow at first. The scenery description is mostly rich and beautiful but lengthy at times, making it too easy to skip a few pages if you're not a patient reader. But it got better along the way and got me hooked all the same. While the plot is well constructed and the mysteries are steadily built up, the characters are what has drawn me in. They're an allegiance of fascinating individuals: men, elves, dwarves and half-man-half-elf. They are flawed by all means, but at the same time, full of compassion and chivalry. Based on their different origins, their initial interaction often consists of conflicts but the tension is quickly dissolved and transformed through companionship. The dialogues, for the most part, are witty and fluid, if not information-driven sometimes. There are only a handful of battle scenes but they're all swift and engaging. Although I wish for more action, this doesn't affect the story in any major way.The book contains homosexual romance which is mostly hinted or disguised as friendship. I myself rather enjoy the subtlety since, for once, it makes the feeling more genuine and endearing without the characters being irritably needy or cheesy (which unfortunately happens a lot in gay fiction). Besides, it is safe to say they're all PG-13 materials. Nothing graphic or explicit.While the protagonists are strong and well-drawn, the antagonists seem less appealing, except for one of the villains, who turns out to be mostly misunderstood and misguided. The rest of them feel lacking in term of depth and complexity. Then again, this is just the first installment of the trilogy; not all of the bad guys have made their entrance yet. We readers can always expect for more in the later books.On a side note, I regret reading this book late at night and ended up not having enough sleep by the morning. So, don't start this book too close to bed time.",

Includes special features and definitive edition of the text. Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike. One hundred and fifty million copies of its many editions have been sold around the world, and occasional collectors' editions become prized and valuable items of publishing. Now, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its first publication, the text has been fully restored with almost 400 corrections - with the full co-operation of Christopher Tolkien - making it the definitive version, and as close as possible to the version that J.R.R. Tolkien intended. Also included are the original red and black maps as fold-out sheets, a fully revised and enlarged index, and - for the first time - a special plate section containing the pages from the Book of Mazarbul. These 50th anniversary hardback editions feature Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket designs which date from the 1950s, which have been reworked to celebrate this special anniversary. They are collected here in a four-volume boxed set which also includes The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, a unique annotated guide to the text, which will enhance the reader's enjoyment and understanding of the book of the 20th century.",

It made traveling in the camper a little more bearable (barely). Roger and I had read in Parade magazine (Roger can correct me if I am wrong because it was a long time ago...the summer after fourth grade for me) that the hippie community was madly in love with Lord of the Rings. Well, I loved anything hippie at the time, probably because Lowell hated them so much. So Roger and I decided to buy the series but we couldnt find The Fellowship of the Ring. He started first with the Two Towers and I waited for him to finish. Luckily, we didnt have to wade through those first hundred pages of the Fellowship. I remember after I finished the appendix (I so love the appendix) of just weeping and then I had an epiphany. I realized I would never read anything I would love again, as much as I loved the Lord of the Rings. I have loved many books and reread some books many times but nothing has moved me as much as this series.When I had my pre-mission interview the Bishop, he asked me how many times I had read the Book Of Mormon. I replied 12 times and he was shocked. Then the Mormon guilt crept in and I mentioned that I had read Lord of the Rings 27 times. Yes, I use to keep track. I think I have finally reversed the order of which one I have read the most but it has been an herculean effort.Just awhile ago I was mentioning to Kirsten that I wish that Tolkien had done more with women in the series. She had an interesting insight. She said, Given what is happening to men in our society",

In particolare, A Readerâs Companion Ã¨ pieno di informazioni che se non siete dellÐ· patitÐ· della Terra di Mezzo potrebbero narcotizzarvi e lanciare maledizione a quella blogger che vi ha fatto venire voglia di comprarla. Ecco, se Il Signore degli Anelli vi piace, ma non cosÃ¬ tanto, ci sono altre edizioni che fanno la loro bella figura (e costano anche meno).Per quanto mi riguarda, sono stata contenta di farmi accompagnare durante la lettura da A Readerâs Companion per almeno due motivi. Il primo riguarda la lingua: infatti, nonostante The Lord of the Rings non abbia un inglese proibitivo, Tolkien era anche un linguista e ci sono via, via dei termini desueti, o parole usate con unâaccezione particolare. A Readerâs Companion segnala tutti questi termini, dandone spiegazione, senza quindi costringerti a scavare nelle voci dellâOED il significato giusto. Molto comodo.Lâaltro motivo di apprezzamento per A Readerâs Companion Ã¨ stata la fonte di informazioni su una miriade di questioni che riguardano The Lord of the Rings, dalla sua genesi alla sua interpretazione, dai modi in cui alcune parti sono state accolte dallÐ· lettorÐ· (e le successive reazioni di Tolkien) ai suoi legami con le altre opere ambientate su Arda. Molte informazioni erano giÃ  in mio possesso, di altre invece non avevo idea ed Ã¨ stato molto interessante venirne a conoscenza.Per il resto, leggere Il Signore degli Anelli in lingua originale mi ha dato modo di apprezzare le varie voci dei personaggi, che in traduzione sono andate irrimediabilmente perse nelle loro particolaritÃ  linguistiche (e non per colpa di chi ha tradotto, ma per la natura della lingua italiana, non iniziatemi a litigare qua sotto tra pro-Alliata e pro-Fatica, per favore). In particolare, sono rimasta colpita da Tom Bombadil, che in italiano suona piuttosto alieno, mentre in inglese lo si percepisce molto piÃ¹ radicato nella sua terra, sebbene nessunÇ sappia davvero chi sia. La lettura Ã¨ stata accompagnata dalla colonna sonora della trilogia cinematografica di Peter Jackson e, occasionalmente, da del buon metal sinfonico. Giusto per calarmi meglio nellâatmosfera: consigliato, se ascoltate musica durante la lettura.",

          "description":"Originally published in 1930, Kenneth Morris's superb Book of the Three Dragons is an imaginative reworking of elements from the Mabinogion and other Welsh Celtic stories, telling the story of Manawyddan, who is given the choice between immortality with the gods or preventing a new evil from destroying the Island of the Mighty. Manawyddan chooses the latter, and the novel tells of his adventures. Swiftly moving and dramatic, this is a book that lovers of modern fantasy and old hero tales alike cannot afford to miss. Perhaps most importantly for modern readers, for the first time Morris's unpublished ending - amounting to one-third of the book's length - is included in this new edition, telling what became of the hero, his wife, and their son.NOTE ON NEW SERIES: This is the first in our new line of fantasy fiction, which will feature both masterpieces no longer in print in the US as well as new works. The series will be edited by noted Tolkien scholar Douglas A. Anderson, whose previous books include The Annotated Hobbit (HM) and Tales Before Tolkien (Ballantine). Mr. Anderson will also write introductions to each book, providing context and background to enrich the reader's experience. The cover look and interior design will appeal to all demographics (especially younger fans under 30 who play computer fantasy games and love writers like Tolkien, Pratchett, and Pullman) with top artists creating a dazzling fantasy look.Quotes:\"It is a singularly fine example of the recreation of a work magnificent in its own right (the 'Mabinogion') -- a literary event rather rare except in fantasy\" - Ursula Le Guin\"Kenneth Morris was an important, innovative fantasist, worthy to rank with MacDonald, Eddison, and Tolkien.\" - Ursula Le Guin\"Morris writes with all Lord Dunsany's richness, though his cadences are Celtic rather than biblical. This one should be read aloud.\" - review in the Feb. 2004 issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine\"Book of the Three Dragons is perhaps the single best fantasy adaptation from a real-worldup0mythology (in this case, the Welsh Mabinogion), and the best of his talesÂ¿\" - John Rateliff, review in the Sept. 2003 issue of Wizards of the Coast website (www.wizards.com), the #1 adventure gaming company in the world.",

This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.",

Iâve known it for years.â â Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds donât view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds havenât come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterheadâs questions â and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devilâs Snare, Harryâs best mate Ron bellows âHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?â Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him âAre you a wizard, or what?â thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowlingâs books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harryâs bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harryâs last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret âshout-outâ to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that âneither shall live while the other survivesâ, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemortâs Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesnât offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isnât all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowlingâs farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.",

It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of onceÂ¹ when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as âliterature.â I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrongâRowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.Iâve heard it said before that everything you need to know youâve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me. And if youâre good, Iâll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not.â¢ The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely.â¢ The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do.â¢ It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort.â¢ It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you.â¢ Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that youâre afraid to fail is failure in itself.Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. Itâs a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe thatâs an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but thatâs what I got out of it, and thatâs why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own.Â¹This is misleading; Iâve been made fun of countless, countless times.",

          "description":"Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues.The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise.A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. --Daphne Durham ",

For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.",

Iâve known it for years.â â Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds donât view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds havenât come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterheadâs questions â and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devilâs Snare, Harryâs best mate Ron bellows âHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?â Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him âAre you a wizard, or what?â thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowlingâs books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harryâs bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harryâs last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret âshout-outâ to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that âneither shall live while the other survivesâ, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemortâs Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesnât offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isnât all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowlingâs farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.",

It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of onceÂ¹ when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as âliterature.â I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrongâRowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.Iâve heard it said before that everything you need to know youâve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me. And if youâre good, Iâll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not.â¢ The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely.â¢ The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do.â¢ It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort.â¢ It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you.â¢ Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that youâre afraid to fail is failure in itself.Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. Itâs a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe thatâs an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but thatâs what I got out of it, and thatâs why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own.Â¹This is misleading; Iâve been made fun of countless, countless times.",

          "description":"For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig.  As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

For a series like HP thatâs been read by so many people this might be the best solution though. And because the books get longer and longer and because I donât share my friend Jaysonâs amazing and remarkable ability to describe a book in one significant sentence, Iâm afraid youâll have to bear with quite a lot of my thoughts. *lol*1.) âItâs one of the basic rules of breeding,â she said. âYou see it all the time with dogs. If thereâs something wrong with the bitch, thereâll be something wrong with the pup-âAunt Marge is such a horrible person!!! If you ask me sheâs really lucky that Harry is such a precious cinnamon roll and only made her a big bubble gum. *lol* The audacity to talk about his dead parents like that! No wonder Harry got so angry!! Aunt Marge can float to hell! 2.) âIâve already had some,â said Harry. âProfessor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.ââDid he, now?â said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. âSo weâve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.âLupin is the best DADA teacher they ever had and I love him so much! <333 His character is just great and I wish we would have seen even more of him. Unfortunately we werenât blessed with all too many Lupin scenes. >_<3.) âHow extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,â Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. âHe, too, was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirersâ¦ the resemblance between you is uncanny.âAnd speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst! Snape is such a horrible teacher I canât even! I said it once and Iâll say it again: He's cruel, he's a bully, he takes delight in instilling fear in his students. And he verbally and emotionally abuses them. His personal vendetta against Harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy! Movie Snape is way nicer than the one in the books and I'm sorry but if you ask me #SnapeCan'tBeRedeemed!!4.) âTheyâve got a new captain and Seeker",

But I also love that Hedwig finds Harry.ðChapter 4: The Leaky Cauldron After jumping on Ronâs head, Crookshanks gets a new home with Hermione.ðChapter 5: The DementorsHagrid being named a teacher and getting teary-eyed when the trio congratulates him, warms my heart!ð§Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***I greatly enjoy the dive into the Knight Bus. How it appears for wizards in trouble. Itâs also a very interesting point, Harry is quick to help his friends, but doesnât offer any money. Interesting.ðChapter 6: Talons and Tea LeavesMy favorites are tied in this chapter- between Hermione calling out Trelawney about âpredictionsâ and Malfoy getting his ass handed to him by Buckbeak.ðChapter 7: The Boggart in The Wardrobe Obviously my favorite part is Snape dressed as Nevilleâs gran.ðChapter 8: Flight of the Fat LadySo much happening in this chapter- but my fav is simply Nevilleâs gran sending his Hogsmeade permission slip directly to the school, cause sure enough he misplaced his copy.ðChapter 9: Grim DefeatAlas, the whomping willow got its revengeâ¦ on Harryâs broom.ðChapter 10: The Marauders MapI love that the Weasley twins entrust Harry with the map.ð§Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***The points made regarding Snape, his history with Lupin (and his gang), makes for a better understanding of behavior. ðChapter 11: The FireboltRon offering to make tea, for an upset Hagrid, because thatâs what his mom does.ðChapter 12: The PatronusNeville, being Neville, wrote down the passwords and lost them.ðChapter 13: Gryffindor versus RavenclawRon trying to convince everyone that he saw Sirius Black in his room.ðChapter 14: Snapeâs GrudgeHarry scaring the shit out of Malfoy, was the best!ðChapter 15: The Quidditch FinalOf course the best part is Gryffindors win.ð§Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-15***Warning: podcast has adult content***Ron joking with Harry about loaning him money- he didnât even offer to replace your spello tape wandâ¦ not happening my dude.ðChapter 16: Professor Trelawneyâs Prediction Hermione being freaked out by her Boggart final.ðChapter 17: Cat Rat and DogSirius making himself known.ðChapter 18: Moony Wormtail Padfoot and ProngsLupin explaining that the womping willow was planted at Hogwarts because of him.ðChapter 19: The Servant of the Lord Voldemort Ron justifying a rat living for 12 years, by saying his family has taken such great care of him.ðChapter 20: The Dementors KissHarryâs happy thoughts about leaving the Dursleyâs to live with Sirius.ðChapter 21: Hermioneâs SecretOf course Hermione has a time turner.ðChapter 22: Owl Post AgainHarry having a godfather in Sirius is so heartwarming.ð§Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 16-22***Warning: podcast has adult content***This one made me a bit tearful.ð¬Movie #3This one is rough, cause so much of the story is missing- but I will simply say, I love how Hermione calls Ron âRonaldâ throughout. Thatâs some great foreshadowing.ð§Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***All good points made- Trelawney casting is so spot on!And that concludes my re-read of Prisoner of Azkaban.

              "review":"If this was a television show, this volume would be a good candidate for the start of the second season. We had a finale with an ominous fight (more a massacre, really), the first look at the main antagonist, a whole boatload of eerie foreshadowing and new unanswered questions, and the brothers learned a few good lessons and took a crucial step or two towards their ultimate goal. Then on to a new season with the introduction of a new major character and a couple quirky sidekicks, and a new direction for the heroes to explore and look forward to. Even Scar is making a return.It's also where the (first) anime makes its final and decisive deviation from the manga. I don't have too many good memories of the anime from this point on, which may have further enhanced my enjoyment of the manga as a contrast, a better alternative.",

          "description":"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com",

Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy.

              "review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy.

Hat es etwa damit zu tun, dass ein gefÃ¼rchteter Verbrecher in die Schule eingedrungen ist und es auf Harry abgesehen hat? Mit seinen Freunden Ron und Hermine versucht Harry ein Geflecht an Verrat, Rache, Feigheit und Verleumdung aufzudrÃ¶seln und stÃ¶Ãt dabei auf Dinge, die ihn fast an seinem Verstand zweifeln lassen.",

BientÃ´t, ce sera la rentrÃ©e Ã  Poudlard, avec les autres Ã©tudiants de sixiÃ¨me annÃ©e. Mais pourquoi Dumbledore vient-il en personne chercher Harry chez les Dursley? Dans quels extraordinaires voyages au cÅur de la mÃ©moire va-t-il l'entraÃ®ner?Sujet : Dans une atmosphÃ¨re assombrie par des meurtres violents et des destructions inexpliquÃ©es, cette sixiÃ¨me annÃ©e Ã  Poudlard voit Harry prendre la tÃªte de l'Ã©quipe de Quiddich. Il apprÃ©cie tout particuliÃ¨rement l'utilisation d'un manuel de potions ayant appartenu Ã  un mystÃ©rieux prince de sang mÃªlÃ© et rempli d'annotations, qui lui permet de briller dans cette matiÃ¨re et de gagner un temps prÃ©cieux... Commentaire : Une violence accrue dans une atmosphÃ¨re sombre et pesante caractÃ©rise ce nouveau volet des aventures de Harry Potter, d'oÃ¹ l'humour disparaÃ®t. Ce jeune sorcier prodige grandit et s'il n'est plus directement confrontÃ© Ã  Lord Voldemort, du moins par la pensÃ©e, la puissance que regagne indiscutablement ce personnage ne lui laisse guÃ¨re de rÃ©pit ! Suspicion, trahison et batailles sanglantes semblent devenir le lot quotidien de Harry. Dans ce contexte, le conflit qui anime Ron et Hermione et les flirts qui vont et viennent entre les Ã©lÃ¨ves semblent bien futiles. Un roman aux rebondissements multiples, aux rÃ©ponses incomplÃ¨tes qui se termine sur une note bien sombre.",

              "review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy.

              "review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy.

He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years.
